/**
 * Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) callback functions needed by
 * Java Native Access (JNA) so that a FMU * can perform functions like
 * allocating and freeing memory, printing log messages and handle the
 * end of a step.
 *
 * <p>The C language interface to Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) files
 * includes a fmiCallbackFunctions struct whose elements are callbacks
 * to methods are called to log status messages, allocate memory,
 * free memory and to notify the system that the step is finished.
 * This class encapsulates those callbacks.</p>
 *
 * <p>For details about how Callbacks work in JNA, see
 * <a href="http://twall.github.com/jna/3.4.0/javadoc/overview-summary.html#callbacks">http://twall.github.com/jna/3.4.0/javadoc/overview-summary.html#callbacks</a>.</p>

     *  A class that contains references to the callback functions.
     *
     *  <p>This class is used to register callbacks and pass the callbacks
     *  to the fmiInstantiateSlave() or fmiInstantiateModel() method.
     *  For example FMUCoSimulation.java contains the following code:</p>
     *
     *  <pre>
     *   FMICallbackFunctions.ByValue callbacks = new FMICallbackFunctions.ByValue(
     *           new FMULibrary.FMULogger(), new FMULibrary.FMUAllocateMemory(),
     *           new FMULibrary.FMUFreeMemory(),
     *           new FMULibrary.FMUStepFinished());
     *
     *   Function instantiateSlave = fmiModelDescription.getFmiFunction("fmiInstantiateSlave");
     *
     *   Pointer fmiComponent = (Pointer) instantiateSlave.invoke(Pointer.class,
     *            new Object[] { _modelIdentifier, fmiModelDescription.guid,
     *                    fmuLocation, mimeType, timeout, visible, interactive,
     *                   callbacks, loggingOn });
     *  </pre>
     *
     *  <p>The Structure.ByValue interface is a marker interface that indicates
     *  that the <b>value</b> value of a Structure is to be used by function
     *  invocations instead of the address of the Structure.  This is necessary
     *  because the default is that Structure arguments and return values
     *  are usually accessed by reference.  For details, see
