<h1>SpontaneousSources</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model opens two interactive shells into which you can type
and reports the time (since the start of execution) when you type
something in either shell.  Normally, the InteractiveShell actor blocks
until you type something, so each firing would block execution
in other parts of the model.  Here, each InteractiveShell is placed
within a ThreadedComposite with the delay parameter set to
UNDEFINED and synchronizeToRealTime set to true.
Thus, the InteractiveShell actors execute in their own threads,
and when they produce outputs, the outputs are assigned time
stamps equal to real time.</p>
