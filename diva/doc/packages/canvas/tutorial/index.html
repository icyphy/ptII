<h1>The Diva Canvas Tutorial</h1>

The directory <B>canvas/tutorial</B> in the Diva distribution contains
a set of programs that are designed to illustrate how to use key
features of the canvas.  Each class is self-contained, so that you can
see all of the code in one place, and as short as possible given the
constraints of making them somewhat realistic.

 <p> The following pages are an introduction to each of the programs,
and designed to provide a starting point for reading the code.  Small
code snippets are used to illustrate, but the key reference is of
course the code itself.  As well as reading the source file, you can
read the <a
href="../../../api/diva/canvas/tutorial/package-summary.html">javadoc
for the tutorial package</a>.

<p>
The tutorial pages were written assuming that you will run each
tutorial example as you read.  Each page gives the name of the
relevant Java class. To run that program, change to the
<B>diva/canvas</B> directory and type:

<pre>
  make FigureTutorial
</pre>

(where FigureTutorial is replaced by the class you want to run).
A Java window will appear where you can see and manipulate the
figures.
