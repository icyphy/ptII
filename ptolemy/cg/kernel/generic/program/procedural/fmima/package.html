    <p>Generate code for the Functional Mockup Unit Master Algorithm (FMIMA).</p>

    <p>Two master algorithms are available:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>FMI 2.0 CoSimulation MA</li>
    <li>FMI Hybrid MA</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This code generator use the algorithm defined in

      Technical Report No. UCB/EECS-2013-153
      August 18, 2013. Which is a version of a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2555756">EMSOFT '13 paper</a>.</p>

    <p>The only difference among <em>FMI 2.0 CoSimulation MA</em> and <em>FMI Hybrid MA</em> is the representation of time. In the FMI Hybrid MA, time is represented as an integer, where all the FMUs <b>must</b> agree on the same time precision.</p>

    <p>The Hybrid FMUs are located in <code>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/fmi/fmus/Hybrid*</code>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The <code>ptolemy.cg</code> has a lot of classes, but the FMIMA work consists of only a few classes.</p>

    <p>The easist way to work with the code is to look for the <code>fmima</code> directories and then the <code>.java</code> files</p>
    <pre>
      bash-3.2$ cd $PTII/ptolemy/cg
      bash-3.2$ find . -name fmima
      ./adapter/generic/program/procedural/fmima
      ./kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima
      bash-3.2$ find ./adapter/generic/program/procedural/fmima -name "*.java"
      ./adapter/generic/program/procedural/fmima/adapters/ptolemy/actor/Director.java
      ./adapter/generic/program/procedural/fmima/adapters/ptolemy/actor/lib/fmi/FMUImport.java
      ./adapter/generic/program/procedural/fmima/adapters/ptolemy/actor/TypedCompositeActor.java
      ./adapter/generic/program/procedural/fmima/test/junit/JUnitTclTest.java
      bash-3.2$ find ./kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima -name "*.java"
      ./kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima/FMIMACodeGenerator.java
      ./kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima/FMIMACodeGeneratorAdapter.java
      ./kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima/test/junit/JUnitTclTest.java
      bash-3.2$ 
    </pre>

    <h2>Invocation of the FMI MA code generators</h2>
    
    <p>The main entry point is <code>$PTII/ptolemy/cg/kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima/FMIMACodeGenerator.java</code>.  When the code generator is invoked, that class is instantiated.</p>

    <p>Run <code>$PTII/bin/ptcg -help</code> to see other command line arguments.</p> 

    <p>Below is the command to run a sample model:</p>

    <h3>Invoking FMI 2.0 CoSimulation MA</h3>
    <pre>
      $PTII/bin/ptcg -language fmima $PTII/ptolemy/cg/kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima/test/auto/emsoft2013.xml
    </pre>

    <h3>Invoking FMI Hybrid MA</h3>
    <pre>
      $PTII/bin/ptcg -language fmima -dialect hybrid $PTII/ptolemy/cg/kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima/test/auto/Test4.xml
    </pre>

    <p>In Test4.c you can find the MA, while in results.cv there is
    the output of the simulation. The output show all the interface
    signals of all the FMUs and therefore it is a little bit hard to
    read at a first glance. However the name of the signals are
    self-explanatory and you can easily understand the signal
    traces.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>In a nut shell, the code iterates through the model, finding actors and attributes. An adapter class is searched for that will handle each actor and attribute. If an adapter is not found, then an adapter for the parent class of the actor or attribute is searched for.</p>

    <h3>What to modify</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>$PTII/ptolemy/cg/kernel/generic/program/procedural/fmima/FMIMACodeGenerator.java</code></dt>
      <dd>Copies the C files in <code>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/fmi/ma/includes/</code> and <code>shared/</code></dd>
      <dt><code>$PTII/ptolemy/cg/adapter/generic/program/procedural/fmima/adapters/ptolemy/actor/TypedCompositeActor.c</code></dt>
      <dd>The template file that includes the body of the Master Algorithm.</dd>
    </dl>
