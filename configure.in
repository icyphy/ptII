# configure is derived from configure.in by running GNU autoconf
# on configure.in.  Sadly, autoconf now requires Perl and is much
# slower than it used to be.
# See $PTII/doc/coding/develsetup.htm for details about how configure
# works.
# To modify configure:
# 1. Edit configure.in
# 2. Run: cd $PTII; rm config.*; autoconf; ./configure
# 3. When you are satisfied with your changes, check in configure.in:
#       cvs commit -m "Added xxx package" configure.in
# 4. Since configure.in will have a more recent modification time than
#    configure, be sure to run autoconf again
# 5. Check in configure:
#       cvs commit -m "configure.in changed" configure
# NOTE: sometimes the order that the files are updated when cvs update
# is run can cause configure.in to have a more recent mod time than
# configure.  If this is the case, try editing configure and adding
# a space to a comment line and commiting the change.

dnl Don't look for ptolemy/kernel/util/NamedObj.java here, or
dnl else we won't be able to rebuild after make extraclean.

It could be that you have incorrectly set PTII.
If you have installed Cygwin in c:/cygwin, and your Ptolemy II installation
is in a directory outside of the c:/cygwin tree, then Cygwin may
change your PTII variable to include "/cygdrive/c".  This
will cause problems with non-Cygwin tools like javac that do
not understand /cygdrive/c

PTII can end up with cygdrive or cygwin in it if
you mistakenly do something like PTII=`pwd`.

Under Cygwin, try permanently setting PTII in the control panel 
(Start->Control Panels->Advanced->Environment Variables)
or temporary set it within bash:
  PTII=c:/users/yourname/ptII
  export PTII
