<h1>Static Units System</h1>
<p>
The Static Units System in Ptolemy II provides the means to constrain a model in terms
of the allowable units of measure for the actors, and ports on the actors.
It is static, in that the constraints do not relevant when the model is run.
Rather, the constraints are used to determine if the model is correct.
</p>
<p>
In order to illustrate these concepts, the Fermenter model, shown here, will be used.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The purpose of this model is simulate the growth process in a fermenter.
There are three
submodels; 1) growth models the number of cells being produced as a
function of the current number of cells and the vat temperature,
2) HeatProduction models the amount of heat produced (in calories) as
a function of the amount of work done (in joules), and 3) HeatExchanger
models the removal of heat from the vat as a function of the rate at
which water flows through the cooling jacket around the vat.

<h2>Port Units Specifications</h2>
In order to see the units sepcifications on the ports of the actors
the PortConfigurerDialog must be used.
Right mouse click on the actor and select "Configure Ports".
For example, applying the PortConfigurerDialog to the HeatExcnager actor shows
<p>
<center>
<img src="Fermenter2.gif" alt="port configuration for Heat Exchanger">
</center>
</p>
<p>
Note the units column which shows that,
the TempVessel port has units <b>degree</b>,
the TempCW port has units <b>degree</b>,
the output port has units <b>calories/second</b>,
and, the flow port has units <b>gallons/hour</b>.
</p>
<h2>Actor Units Specifications</h2>
In order to see the units sepcifications on the actors
the ConfigureUnitsDialog must be used.
Right mouse click on the actor and select "Configure Units".
For example, applying the ConfigurerUnitsDialog to the AddSubtract actor shows
<p>
<center>
<img src="Fermenter3.gif" alt="unit constraints for AddSubtract">
</center>
</p>
<p>
This shows that there are two units constraints for the AddSubtract actor.
The expression <b>$plus=$minus</b> says that the plus and minus ports must have the
same units. That is, it is incorrect to subtract <b>gallons/hour</b> from <b>gallons</b>.
Similarly, the expression <b>$output=$minus</b> says that the output port must have
the same units as the minus port.
</p>
<p>
Some of the units constraints in the model are inconsistent.
In addition to the HeatExchanger port unitconstraints, and AddSubtract actor unit constraints
illustrated above,
the HeatProduction.heat port has the units <b>calories</b>.
Since the HeatProduction.heat port is connected (via the AddSubtract actor)
to the HeatExchanger.output port which has units <b>calories/second</b>
the model is inconsistent in terms of the units constraints.
<p>
The UnitsConstraint Solver can be used to discover, and
analyse these inconsistencies. (Right mouse-click and select
UnitsConstraint Solver).
