<h1>Heterochronous Dataflow Domain</h1>
The Heterochronous Dataflow (HDF) domain, created by Ye Zhou,
is an extension of the Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) domain. In SDF,
the set of port rates (called rate signatures) of an actor are constant.
In HDF, however, rate signatures are allowed to change between iterations
of the HDF schedule. The change of rate signatures can be modeled by
state transitions of a modal model, in which each state refinement infers
a set of rate signatures. Within each state, the HDF model behaves like
an SDF model.
