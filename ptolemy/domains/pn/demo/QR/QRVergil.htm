This model shows the result of a Process Network (PN) executing
the QR-algorithm on a continuous stream of data that is coming from an
array of antennas. Each execution of the algorithm on a new set of
data from the antennas is called an update. The applet shows the
matrix R in a <I>MatrixViewer</I>. This matrix is of size NxN, where N
is the number of antenna's involved. The individual entries in the
matrix are also shown in the <I>Plotter</I>. The matrix R is obtained
after doing a certain number of QR-algorithm updates on a stream of
data coming from the antenna array of a certain size.
</p>

<P>
In the demo, if we select 10 QR-updates for an array of 6 antenna's,
the following R matrix must be found: </P>

The QR algorithm describes a linear algebra problem in which a matrix
A can be written as a product of two matrices Q and R (A=QR). The
matrix R is an upper triangular matrix and matrix Q is an orthogonal
matrix. A program that does this QR transformation is given below in
the Matlab programming language. The algorithm uses the Cordic
functions <I>Vectorize </I>and <I>Rotate </I>to find the QR
transform. If we execute this program in Matlab, we would find the
same matrix R.</P>

<PRE>
%% Initialize Matrix r
for j = 1:1:N,
 for i = j:1:N,
   [r(j,i)] = _ReadMatrix_Zeros_64x64();
 end
end

%% Initialize Matrix x
for k = 1:1:K,
 for j = 1:1:N,
   [x(k,j)] = _ReadMatrix_U_1000x16();
 end
end

%% do the QR updates
for k = 1:1:K,
 for j = 1:1:N,
   [r(j,j), x(k,j), t ] = Vectorize( r(j,j), x(k,j) );
   for i = j+1:1:N,
      [r(j,i), x(k,i), t] = Rotate( r(j,i), x(k,i), t );
   end
 end
end

%% After the K iterations, collect the values of the R Matrix
for j = 1:1:N,
 for i = j:1:N,
   [ Sink(j,i) ] = Rout( r(j,i) );
 end
end
</PRE>

<P>However, we can also describe the same QR-algorithm as a <I>Process
Network</I>, as shown in this model.</P>
