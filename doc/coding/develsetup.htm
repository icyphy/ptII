    <h1>Setting up a development tree</h1>

    <p>This page describes how local developers setup parallel development
      trees.  The information below is primarily for use by developers at
      U.C. Berkeley.  Remote sites doing Ptolemy II development may want to
      emulate the U.C. Berkeley developer setup.</p>

    <p>We also include notes about various configuration management issues.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="#ParallelTrees">Parallel Trees</a>
      <li> <a href="#RenamingActors">Renaming Actors</a>
      <li> <a href="#ExternalPackages">External Packages</a>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="ParallelTrees">Parallel Trees</a></h2>

    <p>Currently, the Subversion (SVN) Repository for the Ptolemy II tree is on
      <code>repo.eecs.berkeley.edu</code>.  The Ptolemy II Subversion
      repository is world-readable.  Write access to the Ptolemy Subversion
      Repository is by invitation only.  We consider software releases a
      form of publication, so we would like to be sure our software is of
      suitable quality.</p>

    <p>Instructions for setting up your parallel tree can be found at
      <a href="http://www.chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/" target="_top"><code>http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/</code></a>.</p>


    <h2><a name="RenamingActors">Renaming Actors</a></h2>
    <p>Below are the steps necessary to rename an actor:</p>

    <ol>
      <li> Use svn to move the file:
	<pre>
	  svn mv foo/Bar.java bif/Boo.java
	</pre>
      </li>
      <li> Remove the file from the makefile in the old directory (<code>foo/makefile</code>)</li>
      <li> Add the file to the makefile in the old directory (<code>bar/makefile</code>)</li>

      <li> Edit the .java file in the new directory and change the package
	and the comment at the top if necessary.</li>

      <li> Compile the new file.</li>
      <li> Check in the change
	<pre>
	  snv commit -m "Moved Bar from foo to bif and renamed it to Boo." foo/Bar.java bif/boo.java foo/makefile bif/makefile
	</pre>
      </li>
      <li> Move any tests from the old test directory with <code>svn mv</code>.</li>

      <li> Run the tests in both the old and new directory.</li>

      <li> If present, then update the .xml files that name the actor in each directory.</li>

      <li> Check the nightly build the next day for errors.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="ExternalPackages">External Packages</a></h2>
    Ptolemy II uses various external, third party packages.

    <p>There are several types of external, third party packages
      <ol>
	<li>Third party packages that we include in <code>$PTII/lib</code>.  These packages are freely available, not too large and have BSD compatibile license.  These packages are distributed with Ptolemy II releases.
	<li>Third party packages that are checked in to the tree under <code>$PTII/vendors</code>.  These packages may have more restrictive licenses, be large, or are of limited use.  These packages are <b>not</b> distributed with the Ptolemy II release.
	<li>Packages with commercial or GPL licenses.  These are never checked in to the tree.  The <code>$PTII/configure</code> looks for these packages in places like <code>$PTII/vendors</code>.
      </ol>

    <p>Not all users will have these packages installed, so the 
      build and runtime environment needs to allow users to build
      with and without the external packages and to have the external
      packages in different locations.</p>

    <p>Packages that are large or have restricted copyrights (such as GPL)
      should go into <code>ptII/vendors</code>. 
      In general, <b>do not</b> add GPL'd code to the repository.
      See <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptIIfaq.htm#ptolemy%20II%20copyright#in_browser">What is the copyright and license?</a> in the Ptolemy II FAQ.</p>

    <p>Large packages should optionally be placed in a separate repository
      and a directory in <code>$PTII/vendors</code> should be created
      that contains a <code>README.txt</code> file that describes how
      to obtain the package (either by download or by using version control (cvs, svn, git etc.).</p>

    <h3>Build-time considerations</h3>

    <p>Adding a third-party package involves changes in several places:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Typically, Ptolemy Java classes that use a third party package go into directory that is named for the package.
      <li><code>$PTII/configure</code>, which creates configuration files for make,
	<a href="ant.htm">ant</a> and <a href="../eclipse/index.htm">Eclipse</a>,</li>
      <li>Third party packages may need to be excluded from Kepler.</li>
      <li>Maven, which reads in <code>$PTII/pom.xml</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each of the above is described below.</p>

    <h4>Adding a directory</h4>

    <p>The Ptolemy Java classes that use a third party package typically
    go into a directory that shares the name of the package.  The
    reason is that it is helpful to group dependencies so that if a
    configuration does not need to use functionality provided by a
    third party package, then it is easy to exclude.</p>

    <p>For details, see the <a href="coding/coding.pdf#in_browser" target="_top">Checklist for creating a new directory</a> at the end of the Ptolemy Coding Style document.</p>

    <h4>configure.in</h4>

    <p>During development, we use GNU autoconf to read in
      <a href="../../configure.in"><code>$PTII/configure.in</code></a> to generate 
      <a href="../../configure"><code>$PTII/configure</code></a>.
      During the build process, users run
      <a href="../../configure"><code>$PTII/configure</code></a> which
      reads in 
      <a href="../../mk/ptII.mk.in"><code>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk.in</code></a>
      and substitutes in makefile variables and creates
      <a href="../../mk/ptII.mk"><code>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk</code></a>.</p>

    <p>In addition, <a href="../../configure"><code>$PTII/configure</code></a>
      reads in <a href="../../build.xml.in"><code>$PTII/build.xml.in</code></a>
      and produces <a href="../../build.xml"><code>$PTII/build.xml</code></a>,
      which is used by <a href="ant.htm">ant</a> and the nightly build.</p>

    <p>The primary method is to look for a directory
      that contains the external package.  Another method
      is to compile a program that uses the package and see if
      it works.   Usually, all you need to do is to try to compile a file
      that imports the package.  The javasound and java3d portions
      of configure.in try to compile files from $PTII/conf that
      contain the appropriate import statements.</p>

    <p>Below is a rough outline of the steps necessary to add a package.
      by looking for a directory.
      In general, your best bet is to find a similar package that
      has already been added and mimic that setup.</p>

    <ol>
      <li> Edit 
	<a href="../../mk/ptII.mk.in"><code>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk.in</code></a>
	and add three variables for your package:
	<pre>
	  # KVM is the JDK for PalmOS, see
	  # http://java.sun.com/products/kvm
	  KVM_CLASSES = @KVM_CLASSES@

	  # Directory that contains the kvm used by PalmOS
	  KVM_DIR = @KVM_DIR@

	  # Set to kvm and used in $PTII/ptolemy/makefile if the PalmOS KVM was found
	  PTKVM_DIR =	@PTKVM_DIR@
	</pre>
      </li>
      <li> Edit 
	<a href="../../configure.in"><code>$PTII/configure.in</code></a> 
	and add a new section for your package.  It is easiest to
	copy a section for an existing package.  There are many small
	design decisions to be made here:
	<ul>

	  <li> Check to be sure that the package is actually required.
	    <br>configure.in can be used for small Ptolemy II trees that
	    might not have all the source code, so be sure to check
	    that the external package is actually needed.

	    <br/>In <code>configure.in</code>, lines like
	    <pre>
	      updateClasspath "$CALTROP_DIR/ptCal.jar"
	    </pre>
	    update both the <a href="ant.htm">ant</a> and <a href="../eclipse/index.htm">Eclipse</a> classpaths.
	  </li>

	  <li> What happens if the package is not present?
	    <br>Print a useful message stating what this package is used
	    for and where to get it.</li>

	  <li> External packages that we cannot ship should go
	    in <code>$PTII/vendors</code>.  See 
	    <a href="../../vendors/README.txt"><code>$PTII/vendors/README.txt</code></a>
	    for information about naming conventions.  The configure
	    script should look in <code>$PTII/vendors</code> for
	    the external package.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li> Run
	<pre>
	  cd $PTII
	  rm -f config.status config.cache; autoconf; ./configure
	</pre>
	until you get the settings in <code>ptII.mk</code> right.</li>

      <li> If you Ptolemy II code requires that the package be present
	at compile time, then place your .java files in a subdirectory
	with the same name as the package, and use the 
	<code>PTKVM_DIR</code> makefile variable in the makefile
	<B>above</B> your package to determine whether make runs
	in your Ptolemy II code.  
	<br/>For example, <code>$PTII/ptolemy/apps/kvm</code> requires
	that kvm be present to compile.  <code>configure</code> sets
	the <code>PTKVM_DIR</code> makefile variable to <code>kvm</code>
	if the kvm package was found.  
	<a href="../../ptolemy/apps/makefile"><code>$PTIIptolemy/apps/makefile</code></a>
	uses <code>PTKVM_DIR</code> in the <code>DIRS</code> variable
	to select whether make goes into the <code>kvm</code> subdirectory:

	<pre>
	  # $PTII/configure looks for various packages and sets variables
	  # in $PTII/mk/ptII.mk if these packages are found, otherwise
	  # the variables are empty
	  #
	  # PTKVM_DIR is set to kvm by configure if the kvm runtime was found
	  # PTLEGO_DIR is set to lego if the commapi was found.
	  # PTWABA_DIR is set to waba if waba was found
	  #
	  DIRS =		 agilent $(PTKVM_DIR) $(PTLEGO_DIR) $(PTWABA_DIR)
	</pre>
      </li>

      <li> In the makefile where you actually compile the .java files
	that use the package, use <code>KVM_CLASSES</code> to
	set the CLASSPATH:
	<pre>
	  CLASSPATH="$(ROOT)$(CLASSPATHSEPARATOR)$(KVM_CLASSES)"
	</pre>
	If you need access to a binary in the external package tree, use
	the <code>KVM_DIR</code> makefile variable.</li>

      <li>Run <a href="ant.htm">ant</a> and <a href="../eclipse/index.htm">Eclipse</a> and be sure those builds work.</li>

      <li> Create a <code><i>package</i>-license.htm</code> file that
	describes the copyright and license for the third party
	package.  This file should be in the same directory as
	the Java class that uses the third party package.</li>

      <li> Ptolemy II includes a system to determine what third party
	packages are used by a particular configuration.  To see
	the list of packages, follow the copyright links on the
        Help | About page.
        When adding a third party package, update
	<code>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/gui/GenerateCopyrights.java</code>
	and add the class name of the primary class of the third
	party package and the path to the 
        <code><i>package</i>-license.htm</code> file.
	in <code>GenerateCopyrights.java</code> add something like:
	<pre>
	  _addIfPresent(copyrightsMap, "com.sun.jna.Pointer",
	  "lib/jna-license.htm");
	</pre>
        Add a similar line for your jar file and test that it works by
        compiling, invoking Vergil and selecting Help | About</li>

    <li>In addition, the new directory should be added to the following places:
    <dl>
      <dt><code>$PTII/mk/jnlp.mk</code></dt>
      <dd>This make file fragment is included in <code>$PTII/makefile</code> and <a href="../webStartHelp_index.htm" target="_top">WebStart</a>.  Typically, the jar file for the ptolemy directory is added under <code>FULL_ONLY_JNLP_JARS</code>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>$PTII/doc/makefile</code></dt>
      <dd>configure typically sets a <code>XXX_PACKAGES</code> makefile variable in $PTII/mk/ptII.mk that lists the Ptolemy
	packages that are compiled.  This variable <code>XXX_PACKAGES</code> variable is passed to <code>javadoc</code> to generate documentation.   Typically, the package is added to the <code>ALLPACKAGES</code> variable.</dd>
      <dt><code>adm/gen-N.M/ptIIN_M_devel_setup_windows.xml</code></dt>
      <dd>This file is used by the installer.  Updating it is optional.</dd>
    </dl>
    </li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Kepler</h4>
    <p>Since <a name="#kepler">Kepler</a> uses Ptolemy II, it is best to update the Kepler
      files that exclude Ptolemy II third party directories.  See
      <a href="https://kepler-project.org/developers/reference/update-ptolemy-third-party-package-dependencies" target="_top">https://kepler-project.org/developers/reference/update-ptolemy-third-party-package-dependencies</a></p>
    
    <p>To check your work, <a href="https://kepler-project.org/developers/reference/kepler-and-eclipse">download and build Kepler under Eclipse</a>.</p>	  

    <h4>Maven</h4>
    <p>In addition, the dependency must be added
      to <code>$PTII/pom.xml</code> so
      that <a href="maven.htm">maven</a> knows about it.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Search the web for the the xml code necessary to add the the dependency.  For most packages, searching for <code>maven packagename</code> will find the xml.</li>
      <li>Add the xml to <code>$PTII/pom.xml</code></li>
      <li>Run <code>mvn compile</code></li>
    </ol>

    <p>If there is no public Maven repository for the jar, then it will need to be added to 
      <a href="http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/src/maven/">http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/src/maven/</a>.  See <a href="http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/chess/faq/63.html">How do I update workgroup pages using SVN?</a></p>

    <h3>Run-time considerations</h3>
    <p>When <code>configure</code> runs, it also reads in
      <code>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke.in</code> and generates
      <code>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke</code>.  When make is run in the
      bin directory, <code>ptinvoke</code> is copied to the various
      startup scripts like <code>vergil</code> and <code>ptolemy</code>.
      Note that all the startup scripts share a common body and
      use a switch statement to select the appropriate jar files
      at runtime.</p>

    <p><code>ptinvoke.in</code> issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> In general, do not add external packages to the <code>ptolemy</code>
	switch section.  The ptolemy command should not require non-standard
	packages that we do not ship.  The right solution is to add another
	switch section that uses your package.</li>

      <li> If you want to create a new startup script, add a section to
	the switch statement and edit <code>$PTII/bin/makefile</code>.</li>

    </ul>
