<h1>The Multiple-Document Interface text-editor</h1>

 <p>Class: <B>MDIApplicationTutorial</B>

<p> Let's step back to the basic text-editor again.  The view management that
we had was truly simple... Too simple.  We could spruce it up and provide
some way to switch between documents, but that is working around the problem.
The problem is that we really only have one view.  A much better way to 
implement this application is to have a single view for each document and
making each view an independently manipulable object.  The MDIApplication
abstract class provides exactly this functionality.  The view for each document
is placed in an internal frame that can be moved, or maximized, or hidden. 

<p> For this tutorial, alot of the code is the same as the code in the
ApplicationTutorial.  In fact all the code in the initialize methods is
exactly the same: The same actions, the same menu bars, the same toolbars, 
the same document factory and the same file filter.  Let's walk through the 
differences starting with the constructor.

<pre>
    public MDIApplicationTutorial(AppContext context) {
	super();

	// This is an MDI application that uses a desktop context.
        DesktopContext frame = new DesktopContext(context);
        setAppContext(frame);

	initializeApp();
	
        // Initialize the context.  DesktopContext already has a toolbar
	// and a menu bar.
        initializeMenuBar(frame.getJMenuBar());
	JPanel toolBarPane = frame.getToolBarPane();
	toolBarPane.setLayout(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEFT, 2, 2));
        initializeToolBar(frame.getJToolBar());

	// Set the icon in the upper left corner of the context.
	Image iconImage = getResources().getImage("GraphIconImage");
	context.setIconImage(iconImage);
	// Set the icon for the internal frames of the desktop context.
        Icon icon = getResources().getImageIcon("GraphIconImage");
        frame.setFrameIcon(icon);

	// Set the size of the context.
	context.makeComponent().setSize(800, 600);
	// and make it visible.
	context.setVisible(true);
    }
</pre>

<p> First off, we take the AppContext that is passed into the constructor and
wrap it in a DesktopContext.  The desktop context implements the MDIContext
interface, which the MDIApplication requires, but requires another basic
context to place itself in.  This way our multiple-document text editor could
work inside an applet just like the ApplicationTutorial did.  The DesktopContext
assumes that both a toolbar and menubar will be used by the application and
provides them so we don't have to create them manually.  It also provides
a ToolBarPane, which allows our application to manage additional toolbar
if it desires.  The desktop context also allows us to put an icon in the
corner of each internal frame.

<p> So how do we actually create these views?  In the simple application we
had to write a displayDocument() method that would take care of managing the
view.  MDIApplication provides a displayDocument() method that places the
new view in an internal frame for us.  We have to write a createView method
that creates the view for the document, however.

<pre>
    public JComponent createView (Document d) {
	final TextDocument document = (TextDocument) d;
		
	final JEditorPane pane = new JEditorPane();
	pane.setText(document.getText());
		
	pane.getDocument().addDocumentListener(new DocumentListener() {
	    public void changedUpdate(DocumentEvent e) {
		document.setText(pane.getText());
	    }
	    public void insertUpdate(DocumentEvent e) {
		document.setText(pane.getText());
	    }
	    public void removeUpdate(DocumentEvent e) {
		document.setText(pane.getText());
	    }
	});	

	d.addPropertyChangeListener(_titleChanger);

	return pane;
    }
</pre>
<p> Hopefully you recognize the code for creating a new editor pane, and the
document listener that updates the appropriate document whenever new text typed.
The title changer we haven't seen before, however.  It's job is to listen
to the properties of the document and whenever one of them changes, such as
when a file is saved for the first time, it updates the title of the 
internal frame.  The code is shown below.

 
<pre>
    public class TitleChanger implements PropertyChangeListener {
	public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent e) {
	    String name = e.getPropertyName();
	    if (name.equals("file") || 
		name.equals("url") || 
		name.equals("title")) {

		Document doc = (Document)e.getSource();
		DesktopContext context = (DesktopContext)getAppContext();
		JInternalFrame frame = context.getInternalFrame(getView(doc));
		frame.setTitle(doc.getTitle());
	    }
	}
    }
</pre>
<p> The getView() method returns the view that was created for the given
document.  The desktop context's getInternalFrame() method returns the internal
frame that contains the given view.  The context just manages a set of views,
while the MDIApplication base class maps between the documents and the views.

<p> Believe it or not, that's it!  The MDI application is actually a fair bit
simpler to code than a single view application since the base class takes
care of most of the annoying view management parts.
