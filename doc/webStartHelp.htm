<h1>Web Start Help</h1>	
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/" target="_top">Web Start</a>
is a product from Sun that uses the Web to download applications.

<p>The first time a user downloads a Web Start application, they need
to download the Java Web Start client.  That client includes a JVM and
an application manager that allows the user to configure Web Start and
any downloaded Web Start applications.

 <p>You can try downloading Ptolemy II as a Web Start application
by going to
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII2.0/webstart.htm#in_browser" target="_top"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII2.0/webstart.htm</CODE></a>

<p>Web Start Features:
<menu>
<li> Support for multiple JVMS
<li> jar file versioning, which allows users to update an application
without dowloading the entire application
<li> The developer can choose whether the user can download an application
to run it later when not connected to the network.
<li> Support for applets, applications in an applet like sandbox 
and full applications.
</menu>

 <p>The best thing about Web Start is that it is easy to update a small
part of the application and then the next time the users run the app,
they will download just the updated portion instead of having to
download the entire application and reinstall.

 <p>The way Web Start works is that developers create jar files that are
collections of Java .class files, images, platform dependent libraries
and other resources.  An application consists of multiple jar files
and a .jnlp file that describes the application.

 <p>Since shipping a standalone installer usually requires splitting an
application up into components anyway, then the exercise of building
jar files is a useful one, since the jar files could be used for
other installers such as InstallAnywhere or InstallShield.  I use
Web Start as a test bed for figuring out which files need to be
shipped.  Using Web Start for this is usually much faster than running
InstallAnywhere or InstallShield, since if there is a problem in
only one jar file, then only that jar file is affected, and I don't
necessarily need to rebuild a large installer.

 <p>In theory, one can ship one large jar file, but that makes updating
the application more difficult, since if the application changes, the
entire jar file will be downloaded unless a somewhat more complex jar
diff system is used.

 <p>The jar files and the .jnlp file may or may not be signed by using a 
Sun Java code signing certificate.  If all the jars are signed, then
the application can have access to the local disk, and basically looks
like a regular application.  If the jars are not signed, then access
is limited.  It is also possible to run the application in 'sandbox'
mode, which is fairly restrictive, but can still do some useful
things.

 <p>One can use a temporary code signing certificate and eventually pay
Verisign $400/year for a permanent code signing certificate.

<h2>Installing Web Start</h2>

 <p>The basic procedure is that one installs Web Start itself and then
restarts your browser and downloads the Web Start enabled application.

<ol>

<li> Usually, the web page that includes the Web Start enabled application
download attempts to detect if you already have Web Start installed.
If the Web Start detection succeeds, then you need not reinstall Web Start.
 <br>However, the Web Start detection can fail, especially under
<a href="#Netscape6">Netscape 6</a>.  If the detection fails,
the web page will contain text like:
<pre>
 You need to <a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/javawebstart-platform.sh?" target="_top">Install Web Start from Sun</a> before installing . . .
</pre>

<li> You may already have Web Start installed, so you may
want to try clicking on the Web Start enabled application download
and if you
have Java Web start installed, either: 
<menu>
<li> the Java Web Start splash screen
should come up and the download should start.

<li> or you should see a window that asks if you want to download
the file or start up javaws.  Click on <CODE>Open using javaws.exe</CODE>
and then <CODE>OK</CODE>, and the Java Web Start splash screen should come up.

</menu>
If the Java Web Start splash screen comes up, then need not
reinstall Web Start.


<li> If the Java Web Start splash screen did not appear, then
download Java Web Start from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/javawebstart-platform.sh?" target="_top"><CODE>http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/javawebstart-platform.sh?</CODE></a>


<li> Click on the Java Web Start installer executable
<li> Usually, the default location of
<CODE>c:\Program Files\Java Web Start</CODE>
is fine

<li> You may need to restart your browser and go back to
the Web Start enabled application download page.


<li> Note that the Ptolemy II Web Start applications may be
signed with a certificate that is not registered with a certificate
authority, so you may be prompted with a window stating
that the certificate from <CODE>Claudius Ptolemaus</CODE> is unknown.
You should hit the <CODE>OK</CODE> button to proceed with the download

</ol>

<h2><a name="JavaWebStartApplicationManager">Java Web Start Application Manager</a></h2>

<menu>
<li> Under Windows, after you download the Web Start enabled demo, you can run 
it again by going to <CODE>Start</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Programs</CODE>
-:&gt; <CODE>Java Web Start</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Java Web Start</CODE>.
 <br> This will bring up the Java Web Start Application Manager that will
list all the Web Start enabled applications.

<li> In the default, if you run the Web Start enabled application twice,
a window will pop up asking you if you would like to install an
icon for the application in your Start menu and on the desktop.
 <br>This facility is controllable by the Java Web Start Application Manager application
preferences found under <CODE>File</CODE> -&gt; 
<CODE>Preferences</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Shortcut Option</CODE>.

 <br>You can configure Web Start to always install application icons or to
never install them


<li> <a name="consoleOutput">The</a>
 <CODE>File</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Preferences</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Advanced </CODE> pane controls two output options that are useful for 
troubleshooting
<dl>
<dt> <CODE>Show Java Console</CODE>
<dd> If checked, this will bring up the Java console which will
report error messages in the application

<dt> <CODE>Log Output</CODE>
<dd> If checked, this will log the Java Console output to a file. 
This can be very useful if the application is crashing and
the Java Console window is closed before you can read it.
</dl>
</li>
<li> To remove an application, mouse on the application
and then select <CODE>Application</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Remove Application</CODE>
</li>
<li> 
If an update to the application is available, a small yellow triangle will
appear at the bottom of the Web Start application manager when the application
is highlighted.  It is unclear when updating occurs, but one way to trigger
the update is to go back to the website where you initially downloaded
the application and redownload it.  In theory, only the changed jar files will
be pulled over.
</li>

</menu>

<h3>Help while installing</h3>

<h4><a name="installationTimeLimitations">Limitations while installing</a></h4>
<menu>
<li> Roughly half the size of the application download is consumed
by the HTML documentation of the Ptolemy II Java classes.
<li> It would be nice if we use the Web Start jar versioning system.

<li> Web Start sometimes ignores beta JRE versions.  You may find it
necesary to install an earlier JRE version. 

<li> The Web Start Application manager can be used to add and delete
JREs to the list of possible JRES to run.  Try starting up
Web Start and then do File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java
If you already have JRE 1.3.x installed, you can browse to 
where it is located, probably
<CODE>c:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.1</CODE>
and add it
</menu>


<h4><a name="Java3D">Installing Java 3D for use with Web Start</a></h4>
 In theory, Web Start can install Java 3d
automatically, but this is somewhat tough to do.

We have only tested out Java 3D 1.2.1_03 API under JDK1.3.1.

 <p>There are problems with Java 3D 1.2.1_03 API under
JDK1.4.0, when I run a Java3D app, we get:

<pre>
Fail to create back buffer - DDERR_INALIDPARAM
</pre>


 <p>The workaround is to use JDK1.3.1

 <p>Below are some instructions on installing Java3D:

Go to
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/download.html"><CODE>http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/download.html</CODE></a>
and download 
<CODE>Java 3D for Windows (DirectX Version) Runtime for the JRE</CODE>

 <p>Click on the installer.   Eventually, it will prompt you for the JRE
to install Java 3D in.  You should install it under the same JRE
that you are running in Web Start.  

There are at least two ways to determine which JRE you are running:

<ol>
<li> 

1) Start up Ptolemy, go to a model, do <CODE>View</CODE> -&gt;
<CODE>JVM Properties</CODE> and look at the <CODE>java.home</CODE>
 property.  The value of the <CODE>java.home</CODE>
property should be something like 
<CODE>C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.1</CODE>
This value is the JRE that Java 3D should be installed in.


<li> Start up the Web Start Application Manager and do
<CODE>File</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Preferences</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Java</CODE>
and look at the command column of the table.  The Ptolemy II
Web Start edition will use a JVM that is 1.3 or later.
</ol>


<h4><a name="Netscape6">Netscape 6</a></h4>
If you are running under Netscape 6, then the links above
may state that you need to install Web Start from Sun even if you
already have it installed.  The reason is that the Java Script 
code fails to detect Java Web Start under Netscape 6.

 <p>A quick test is to click on one of the Vergil downloads and if you
have Java Web start installed, either: 
<menu>
<li> the Java Web Start splash screen
should come up and the download should start.

<li> or you should see a window that asks if you want to download
the file or start up javaws.  Click on <CODE>Open using javaws.exe</CODE>
and then <CODE>OK</CODE>, and the Java Web Start splash screen should come up.

</menu>


 <p>The Java Web Start FAQ at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/faq.html#11" target="_top"><CODE>http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/faq.html#11</CODE></a> says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>What are the supported browsers? </b> 

JavaTM Web Start supports primarily Internet Explorer 4 or higher and Netscape 4.X. However JNLP files can be launched from any browser if the mime-type association is done correctly. Please note that JavaTM Web Start uses the browsers settings and may launch a browser to show a URL these may/may not work with unsupported browsers.

 <p>JavaTM Web Start works with Netscape 6. However, you will manually need to register JavaTM Web Start with NS6. This is done in the Navigator/Applications section of the Navigator/Helper Application section.

This will be done automatically in a later version of the JavaTM Web Start installer. back to top

<li> If you start up Ptiny then the splash window mentions Ptiny, but if
you then hit <code>Help</code> -&gt; <code>about</code>,
the splash window is the standard full installation window which
includes links to domains and demos that are not included in
the Ptiny release.

<li> Codegen does not work, there are path problems.  The codegen
mechanism looks for the makefile by reading $PTII, and tries to run make.

<li> For Web Start installations, we should disable look inside

<li> The DSP Only quick tour window includes domains and demos
that are not installed.

<li> The GR domain is not likely to work because Java 3D is not installed.

<h4><a name="ptolemyIIjnlpFiles">How Web Start .jnlp files are built in Ptolemy II</a></h4>
In Ptolemy II, the Java Web Start template files are at: 
<code>$PTII/vergil.jnlp.in</code>,
<code>$PTII/vergilPtiny.jnlp.in</code>
and
<code>$PTII/vergilPtiny.jnlp.in</code>.
<p><code>$PTII/mk/jnlp.mk</code> contains
the rules that process the <code>*jnlp.in</code> files and generates 
<code>*.jnlp</code> files.

<p>If the Web Start application is to have full access to the machine,
then the application needs to be signed, which means that the
<code>.jnlp</code> file needs to be copied into the jar file that has
the <code>main()</code> method and the entire jar file signed.  

<p>Since we use the same <code>main()</code> for more than one
application and each application has a separate <code>.jnlp</code>
file, it is necessary to create a separate java class and jar file for each
application.  Those jar files are found in 
<code>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/gui/jnlp</code>.


<h4><a name="fileNotFound">File not found</a></h4>

<p>It turns out that is is necessary to modify Ptolemy II so that if

out the text before the jar URL <code>!/</code> separator and look
for the resource in the classpath.

<p>Another thing to look for is hrefs that are relative and use

I think the problem is with the second time the jnlp file is fetched.
<br>I can run JNLP on the ptolemy web server with basic password based authentication turned on.
<br>I think the problem is that cookies are not yet supported.

<br>The basic password authentication mechanism is a little funky,
sometimes the app starts up without checking for updates.

<h4>Spaces in path names</h4>
Web Start does not work very well if the pathname to the

to place your Ptolemy II tree in a directory that does not have spaces
in the path name if you plan on using Web Start.
