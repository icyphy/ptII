/**
 * Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) 2.0 callback functions needed by
 * Java Native Access (JNA) so that a FMU * can perform functions like
 * allocating and freeing memory, printing log messages and handle the
 * end of a step.
 *
 * <p>The C language interface to Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) files
 * includes a fmiCallbackFunctions struct whose elements are callbacks
 * to methods are called to log status messages, allocate memory,
 * free memory and to notify the system that the step is finished.
 * This class encapsulates those callbacks.</p>
 *
 * <p>For details about how Callbacks work in JNA, see
 * <a href="http://twall.github.com/jna/3.4.0/javadoc/overview-summary.html#callbacks">http://twall.github.com/jna/3.4.0/javadoc/overview-summary.html#callbacks</a>.</p>
