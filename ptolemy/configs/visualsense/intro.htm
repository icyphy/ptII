Modeling of wireless sensor networks requires sophisticated modeling
of communication channels, sensor channels, ad-hoc networking protocols,
localization strategies,
media access control protocols, energy consumption in sensor nodes, etc.
This modeling framework is designed to support a component-based
construction of such models.  It is intended to enable the research
community to share models of disjoint aspects of the sensor nets
problem and to build models that include sophisticated elements from
several aspects.
<p>
Below are simple demonstrations of this modeler (see also the
<a href="completeDemos.htm">complete list of demos</a>):
<ul>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/WirelessSoundDetection/WirelessSoundDetection.xml">
Wireless Sound Detection</a>.
<br> This example models a sound localization problem. A single sound source
moves through a field of sound sensors. The sound sensors detect the sound
and communicate via a radio channel to a sensor fusion component that
localizes the sound by triangulation.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/SmallWorld/SmallWorld.xml">
Small World</a>.
<br> This example illustrates a phenomenon where ad hoc networks achieve
connectivity with fewer hops on average with a network that is less reliable
but where ranges are larger than with a network that is more reliable but
ranges are shorter.

<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/SmartParking/SmartParking.xml">SmartParking</a>

<br> Sensors placed in a parking lot can be used to collect data
(including which parking spot is taken, how long a car has parked on a
spot). The parking lot can process the collected data and provide
some services to clients to guide their parking. This demo illustrates
these ideas. When a sensor detects a car arriving or leaving a spot,
it sends an update to the server of the parking lot, which collects
and processes sensor updates to provide information to parking
clients. The &quot;car model&quot; component models when a car arrives
or leaves, and where to park based on the information the server
provides. It is a abstraction for all the cars dynamics during a
specific time.

<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/EvaderAndPursuer/EvaderAndPursuer.xml">
Evader and Pursuer</a>.
<br> This model shows an "evader"
and a "pursuer" moving through
a sensor network. The "evader"
emits sounds that are detected
by the sensor nodes, and the
sensor nodes relay information
to the pursuer. Running the
model shows the evader moving
at random and the pursuer
seeking to track it based
on the information from the
sensors.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/CircularRange/CircularRange.xml">
Circular Range Channel</a>.
<br> This simple example illustrates a transmitter with a battery model, where
its transmission range decreases (randomly) over time. In this case, a simple
channel model with a circular range is used, and the receiver passes in and
out of range.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/PowerVariability/PowerVariability.xml">
Power Loss Channel</a>.
<br>
This model shows a transmitter and a receiver
where the receiver moves as the model executes and the receive
power density is plotted over time.
The channel is a PowerLossChannel with a limited range. When the
receiver is in range, the power depends on the distance to the
transmitter, according to a formula that is a parameter in the model.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/AntennaPattern/TransmitAntennaPattern.xml">
Transmit Antenna Gain</a>.
<br>
This model illustrates the modeling of transmit antenna gain using
a <i>property transformer</i> model that is registered with the channel.
In this model, the receiver moves in a circular pattern around the
transmitter and measures and plots the received power. The transmitter
has an 8-element phased-array antenna with steering.
See also <a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/AntennaPattern/ReceiveAntennaPattern.xml">Antenna Pattern (Receiver)</a> and
<a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/AntennaPattern/AntennaGainTest.xml">Antenna Gain Calculation</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/Collisions/Collisions.xml">
Collisions</a>.
<br>
This model illustrates the modeling of collisions, where multiple
transmitters send messages with non-zero duration, and collisions can
result in loss of one or both messages, depending on the received
power levels.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/TerrainModel/TerrainModel.xml">
Terrain Model</a>.
<br>
This model illustrates simple terrain effects, where a TerrainModel
object can block transmission if the transmission path crosses its
geometric shape.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/LinkVisualizer/LinkVisualizer.xml">
Link Visualizer</a>.
<br>
This model is a version of Terrain Model that shows the capabilities of 
LinkVisualizer, which displays links between communicating nodes whenever
a transmission is made.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/Intersections/Intersections.xml">
Intersections</a>.
<br>
A simulation of a set of automobile intersections that use wireless to
communicate between traffic signals.  See also the Synchronous/Reactive (SR) 
domain 
<a href="../../domains/sr/demo/TrafficLight/TrafficLight.xml">Traffic Light</a> and 
<a href="../../domains/sr/demo/TrafficLight/WirelessDeployment.xml">Traffic Light Wireless Deployment</a>.  
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/wireless/demo/Zigbee/Zigbee.xml">Zigbee</a>.
<br>A simulation of a Zigbee radio.

This wireless sensor network modeler is built using Ptolemy II, which is a software
framework developed as part of the Ptolemy project at the University of
California at Berkeley. See the

page</a> for more information.
