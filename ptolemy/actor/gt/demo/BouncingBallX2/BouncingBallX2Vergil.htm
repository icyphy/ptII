<h1>BouncingBallX2</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model shows two bouncing ball models
running in separate threads. Each model is
defined in BouncingBall.xml in the same directory.
The model is read and parsed into an ActorToken.
One copy of it is executed in ModelExecutor, which corresponds to the red ball at the top. The other copy
of the ActorToken is sent to two chained transformation rules in ReverseDirection. Those transformation
rules reverse the position and moving direction of the ball and send it to ModelExecutor2. That ball is
shown in blue at the bottom.</p>
