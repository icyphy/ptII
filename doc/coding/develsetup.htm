<h1>Setting up a development tree</h1>

This page describes how local developers setup parallel development
trees.  The information below is primarily for use by developers at
U.C. Berkeley.  Remote sites doing Ptolemy II development may want to
emulate the U.C. Berkeley developer setup.
 <p>We also include notes about various configuration management issues.

<h2><a name="ParallelTrees">Parallel Trees</a></h2>

Currently, the CVS Repository for the Ptolemy II tree is on
<CODE>gigascale.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE>.  Access to the Ptolemy CVS
Repository is by invitation only.  We consider software releases a
form of publication, so we would like to be sure our software is
of suitable quality.

Instructions for setting up your parallel tree can be found at
<a href="http://www.gigascale.org/ptexternal/" target="_top"><CODE>http://www.gigascale.org/ptexternal/</CODE></a>


<h2><a name="browsing">Browsing your tree from the web</a></h2>

If you would like to be able to browse your development tree from the
web, then you should set it up so that the development tree is
not publically available to anyone on the net.

<ol>
<li>  Create a directory for your private webpages:
<pre>
mkdir ~/public_html/private
</pre>

An alternative name is <CODE>~/public_html/local</CODE>

<li> Create a link to a <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> file that limits access:
<pre>
cd ~/public_html/private
ln -s /usr/local/apache/htaccess/ohmCluster .htaccess
</pre>

<li>  Create any links you want from that directory.
<pre>
ln -s ~/ptII .
</pre>
</ol>

<h2><a name="RenamingActors">Renaming Actors</a></h2>
Below are the steps necessary to rename an actor

<ol>
<li> copy the .java file to the new directory.

<li> Remove the file from the makefile in the old directory
<li> Remove the file from the cvs repository in the old directory
<pre>
cvs delete -f Foo.java
cvs commit -m "Moved Foo to new directory blah" Foo.java makefile
</pre>


<li> Edit the .java file in the new directory and change the package
and the comment at the top if necessary.

<li> Add the new file to the makefile in the new directory

<li> Compile the new file

<li> Add the new file to CVS and commit the change to the makefile

<pre>
cd blah
cvs add Foo.java
cvs commit -m "Moved Foo from oldblah directory" Foo.java makefile
</pre>


<li> Move any tests from the old test directory by doing the
copy - cvs delete - edit - cvs add - commit cycle as above

<li> Run the tests in both the old and new directory

<li> Fix up the Vergil palettes in each directory


<li> Update the glimpse index and then search for
instances of the actor name and fix it:
<pre>
cd $PTII
make glimpse
glimpse -H $PTII Foo
</pre>


<li> Update the framemaker documentation

<li> Check the nightly build the next day for errors
</ol>

<h2><a name="ExternalPackages">External Packages</a></h2>
Ptolemy II uses various external packages such as Corba, javacomm and kvm.
Not all users will have these packages installed, so the 
build and runtime environment needs to allow users to build
with and without the external packages and to have the external
packages in different locations.  External packages are usually installed in 
<CODE>ptII/vendors</CODE>, which we do not distribute.

<p>Packages that are large or have restricted copyrights (such as GPL)
should go into <code>ptII/vendors</code>. 
In general, <b>do not</b> add GPL'd code to the repository.
See <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptIIfaq.htm#ptolemy%20II%20copyright#in_browser">What is the copyright and license?</a> in the Ptolemy II FAQ.</p>

<p>Large packages should optionally be placed in a separate repository
and a directory in <code>$PTII/vendors</code> should be created
that contains a <code>README.txt</code> file that describes how
to obtain the package (either by download or by using cvs).
<br>For example, JHDL is a large package that is used 
by the code generator.
<br> <code>$PTII/vendors/jhdl/README.txt</code> would desribe how to
get JHDL.  In this case, it says to use <code>cvs</code> so
that <code>$PTII/vendors/jhdl/ptjhdllib</code> is created.
<br> <code>$PTII/configure</code> would then be modified to 
look <code>$PTII/vendors/jhdl/ptjhdllib</code> for the pieces that it
needs.


<h3>Build-time considerations</h3>

During development, we use GNU autoconf to read in
<a href="../../configure.in"><CODE>$PTII/configure.in</CODE></a> to generate 
<a href="../../configure"><CODE>$PTII/configure</CODE></a>.
During the build process, users run
<a href="../../configure"><CODE>$PTII/configure</CODE></a> which
reads in 
<a href="../../mk/ptII.mk.in"><CODE>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk.in</CODE></a>
and substitutes in makefile variables and creates
<a href="../../mk/ptII.mk"><CODE>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk</CODE></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="../../configure"><CODE>$PTII/configure</CODE></a>
reads in <a href="../../build.xml.in"><code>$PTII/build.xml.in</code></a>
and produces <a href="../../build.xml"><code>$PTII/build.xml</code></a>,
which is used by <a href="ant.htm">ant</a> and the nightly build.</p>


 <p>The primary method is to look for a directory
that contains the external package.  Another method
is to compile a program that uses the package and see if
it works.   Usually, all you need to do is to try to compile a file
that imports the package.  The javasound and java3d portions
of configure.in try to compile files from $PTII/conf that
contain the appropriate import statements.


 <p>Below is a rough outline of the steps necessary to add a package.
by looking for a directory.
In general, your best bet is to find a similar package that
has already been added and mimic that setup.

<ol>
<li> Edit 
<a href="../../mk/ptII.mk.in"><CODE>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk.in</CODE></a>
and add three variables for your package:
<pre>
# KVM is the JDK for PalmOS, see
# http://java.sun.com/products/kvm
KVM_CLASSES = @KVM_CLASSES@

# Directory that contains the kvm used by PalmOS
KVM_DIR = @KVM_DIR@

# Set to kvm and used in $PTII/ptolemy/makefile if the PalmOS KVM was found
PTKVM_DIR =	@PTKVM_DIR@
</pre>

<li> Edit 
<a href="../../configure.in"><CODE>$PTII/configure.in</CODE></a> 
and add a new section for your package.  It is easiest to
copy a section for an existing package.  There are many small
design decisions to be made here:
	<menu>

	<li> Check to be sure that the package is actually required.
	 <br>configure.in can be used for small Ptolemy II trees that
	might not have all the source code, so be sure to check
	that the external package is actually needed.

	<li> What happens if the package is not present?
	 <br>Print a useful message stating what this package is used
	for and where to get it.

	<li> External packages that we cannot ship should go
	in <CODE>$PTII/vendors</CODE>.  See 
<a href="../../vendors/README.txt"><CODE>$PTII/vendors/README.txt</CODE></a>
	for information about naming conventions.  The configure
	script should look in <CODE>$PTII/vendors</CODE> for
	the external package
	</menu>

<li> Run
<pre>
cd $PTII
rm -f config.status config.cache; autoconf; ./configure
</pre>
until you get the settings in <CODE>ptII.mk</CODE> right.

<li> If you Ptolemy II code requires that the package be present
at compile time, then place your .java files in a subdirectory
with the same name as the package, and use the 
<CODE>PTKVM_DIR</CODE> makefile variable in the makefile
<B>above</B> your package to determine whether make runs
in your Ptolemy II code.  
 <p>For example, <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/apps/kvm</CODE> requires
that kvm be present to compile.  <CODE>configure</CODE> sets
the <CODE>PTKVM_DIR</CODE> makefile variable to <CODE>kvm</CODE>
if the kvm package was found.  
<a href="../../ptolemy/apps/makefile"><CODE>$PTIIptolemy/apps/makefile</CODE></a>
uses <CODE>PTKVM_DIR</CODE> in the <CODE>DIRS</CODE> variable
to select whether make goes into the <CODE>kvm</CODE> subdirectory:

<pre>
# $PTII/configure looks for various packages and sets variables
# in $PTII/mk/ptII.mk if these packages are found, otherwise
# the variables are empty
#
# PTKVM_DIR is set to kvm by configure if the kvm runtime was found
# PTLEGO_DIR is set to lego if the commapi was found.
# PTWABA_DIR is set to waba if waba was found
#
DIRS =		 agilent $(PTKVM_DIR) $(PTLEGO_DIR) $(PTWABA_DIR)
</pre>


<li> In the makefile where you actually compile the .java files
that use the package, use <CODE>KVM_CLASSES</CODE> to
set the CLASSPATH:
<pre>
CLASSPATH="$(ROOT)$(CLASSPATHSEPARATOR)$(KVM_CLASSES)"
</pre>
If you need access to a binary in the external package tree, use
the <CODE>KVM_DIR</CODE> makefile variable

<li> Create a <code><i>package</i>-license.htm</code> file that
	describes the copyright and license for the third party
	package.  This file should be in the same directory as
	the Java class that uses the third party package.
<li> Ptolemy II includes a system to determine what third party
	packages are used by a particular configuration.  To see
	the list of packages, follow the copyright links on the
        Help | About page.
        When adding a third party package, update
	<code>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/gui/GenerateCopyrights.java</code>
	and add the class name of the primary class of the third
	party package and the path to the 
        <code><i>package</i>-license.htm</code> file.
<li>  Since Kepler uses Ptolemy II, it is best to update the Kepler
      files that exclude Ptolemy II third party directories.  See
     <a
	href="https://kepler-project.org/developers/reference/update-ptolemy-third-party-package-dependencies"
	target="_top">https://kepler-project.org/developers/reference/update-ptolemy-third-party-package-dependencies</a>
	  
<li> Update <a href="../../build.xml.in"><code>$PTII/build.xml.in</code></a>,
rerun <code>./configure</code> and <code>ant</code> until 
<a href="../../build.xml"><code>$PTII/build.xml</code></a> is correct.</li>

<li> The license file must be included with the jar, see some of the
<code>$PTII/lib/*-license.htm</code> files for examples.  Determine
the license and create a <code>*-license.htm</code> file.  Be
sure to update the <code>makefile</code>.

<li> Ptolemy II uses <code>about:copyright</code> to list copyrights.
For this system to work, a class in the jar file must be added
to <code>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/gui/GenerateCopyrights.java</code>.
For example,
<pre>
        _addIfPresent(copyrightsMap, "com.sun.jna.Pointer",
                "lib/jna-license.htm");
</pre>
Add a similar line for your jar file and test that it works by
viewing the copyrights from within the Vergil help menu.
</pre>


</ol>

<h3>Run-time considerations</h3>
When <CODE>configure</CODE> runs, it also reads in
<CODE>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke.in</CODE> and generates
<CODE>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke</CODE>.  When make is run in the
bin directory, <CODE>ptinvoke</CODE> is copied to the various
startup scripts like <CODE>vergil</CODE> and <CODE>ptolemy</CODE>.
Note that all the startup scripts share a common body and
use a switch statement to select the appropriate jar files
at runtime.

 <p><CODE>ptinvoke.in</CODE> issues
<menu>
<li> In general, do not add external packages to the <CODE>ptolemy</CODE>
switch section.  The ptolemy command should not require non-standard
packages that we do not ship.  The right solution is to add another
switch section that uses your package

<li> If you want to create a new startup script, add a section to
the switch statement and edit $PTII/bin/makefile

</menu>

 <p>Also, you will need to update <CODE>$PTII/.classpath.default</CODE>
and <CODE>$PTII/.classpath.in</CODE> for Eclipse users.

 <p>In Kepler, you will need to modify these files:
<ul>
<li><code>kepler/build-area/resources/eclipse/PtolemyClasspath</code>
<li><code>kepler/build-area/resources/idea/PtolemyModule</code>
<li><code>kepler/build-area/settings/ptolemy-excludes</code>
</ul>
