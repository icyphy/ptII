/**
 * An interface that is used by Java Native Access (JNA) to handle callbacks.
 *
 * <p>This class contains implementations of methods that are registered
 * with the FMI and then called back from by the FMI.  The callback
 * methods allocate and free memory, handle logging and are sometimes
 * called when the step ends.  For each callback we define an inner class
 * that implements the appropriate interface and has one method that
 * provides the body of the callback.</p>
 *
 * <p>For details about how Callbacks work in JNA, see
 * <a href="http://twall.github.com/jna/3.4.0/javadoc/overview-summary.html#callbacks">http://twall.github.com/jna/3.4.0/javadoc/overview-summary.html#callbacks</a>.</p>
