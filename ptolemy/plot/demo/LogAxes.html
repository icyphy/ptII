<h1>Plot using Logarithmic Axes</h1>

The two plots below show the same
<A HREF="logaxes.plt">data</A>, plotted with and without logarithmic
axes.

<p>
To see all the data in the <I>X and Y Linear Axes</I> plot,
try zooming in on the points in the lower left corner.
Both plots include three points that have error bars.
<p>
The code that calculates the grid and labels for logarithmic axes is
based on David Harrison's C version in <CODE>xgraph</CODE>.
<p>
One limitation of the logarithmic axis feature is that sometimes not
enough grid lines are displayed because the range of values is small.
This bug is present in the original C version of xgraph.
However, since logarithmic axes are usually used to show data with
large ranges, this bug usually only shows up when zooming in by hand.
