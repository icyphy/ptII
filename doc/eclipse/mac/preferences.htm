    <h1>Mac OS X: Setting the Eclipse Preferences</h1>
    <p>Eclipse has the notion of a workspace, which is a collection of
      one or more projects.  Ptolemy II is a project. </p>

      <p>When the "Workspace Launcher" window comes up, either stick with the default
      or choose a new directory.  Note that the projects can be located outside
      of the workspace directory.  One caveat is that Eclipse will not permit
      the project directory to be a parent of the workspace directory, so placing the
      workspace in a subdirectory such as the default location is best.
      <br/>Click "OK" to create the workspace and open Eclipse.
      <br/>Below is the Workspace Launcher Window:</p>
      <center><p><img src="../../img/eclipseWorkspaceLauncher.png" alt="Eclipse Workspace Launcher" width="597" height="244"></p></center>

    <p>The "Usage Data Upload" window may appear.  The Eclipse
       developers use this facility to see how Eclipse is used.  We
       recommend selecting "Turn UDC Off" and clicking "Finish".</p>

    <p>Close the Welcome tab by clicking on the X in the tab.  Below is a portion of the Welcome Window:</p>
    <center><p><img src="../../img/eclipseWelcomeTab.png" alt="Eclipse Welcome Tab" width="811" height="262"></p></center>

    <p>The Eclipse Window below will appear:</p>
    <center><p><img src="../../img/eclipseInitialWorkspace.png" alt="Eclipse Welcome Tab" width="511" height="385"></p></center>      
    <p>The default configuration of Eclipse has some difficulties with Ptolemy II,
      so a few changes are necessary.</p>
    <ol>
	<li>Eclipse requires some customization to build Ptolemy II
	  and to keep the <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptIIlatest/ptII/doc/coding/style.htm#in_browser" target="_top">Ptolemy II coding style</a>.
	  In the steps below, we
	  outline changes to be made in the Eclipse Preferences window.

	  <br/> Under Mac OS X the Eclipse Preferences window
	  is invoked via <code>Eclipse</code> | <code>Preferences</code>.

	  <br/>For each of the
	  changes, hit <code>Apply</code>.  When all the changes are done, hit
	  <code>OK</code>, which will close the Eclipse Preferences Window.</li>

	<!--/eclipseSimple-->
	<li>By default, Eclipse rebuilds a project when any change is made
	  to a file.  This will result in thousands of errors when Ptolemy II
	  is first checked out, and during normal usage, can be annoying because
	  of the pauses it creates. We suggest disabling this feature as
	  follows:
	  <ol>
	    <li> While still in the preferences window 
	      <br/> (<code>Eclipse</code> | <code>Preferences</code>)</li>
	    <li> Select <code>General</code> | <code>Workspace</code></li>
	    <li> Deselect <code>Build automatically</code>.</li>
	    <li> Click Apply.</li> 
	  </ol>
	  Below is the <code>General</code> | <code>Workspace</code> window:
	  <center>
	    <p><img src="../../img/eclipsePreferencesGeneralWorkspace.png" alt="Eclipse Preferemces General Workspace" width="624" height="537"></p>
	  </center>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<!--/eclipseSimple-->
	<li>Ptolemy II source files are worked on by many people with different
	  editors.  Unfortunately, different text editors interpret tab
	  characters differently, so it is best to use spaces rather than tabs.
	  <br/>Sadly, the Eclipse developers have chosen to use tabs
	  as spaces, so you must adjust the Eclipse Java Formatter
	  if you plan on contributing code to the Ptolemy II tree.

	  <br/>Also, it is best if files end with new line characters, so
	  that we can run line oriented scripts on them.
	  <br/>In addition, we currently do not want the Eclipse
	  Formatter to format comments because some of the comments
	  include ASCII art diagrams. We hope to change this policy in
	  the future.

	  <br/>We handle these changes together:
	  <ol>
	    <li> While 
	      <!--/eclipseSimple-->
	      still
	      <!--eclipseSimple-->
	      in the preferences window
	      <br/> (<code>Eclipse</code> | <code>Preferences</code>)
	    </li>
	    <li> Go to <code>Java</code> | <code>Code Style</code> | <code>Formatter</code> and click New and go through the steps below, or click Import and select PtolemyIICodeStyle.xml <a href="../PtolemyIICodeStyle.xml">(download here)</a>.
	    </li>
	    <li> In the "New Profile" Window, for the Profile name, enter "Ptolemy II"
	      Under "Initialize settings with the following profile",
	      select "Java Conventions [built-in]"
	      (We use Java Conventions over the "Eclipse"
	      setting because the Eclipse style uses tabs.)
	      Then hit OK
	    </li>
	    <li> Under the "Indentation" tab, change the Tab policy to "Spaces only"
	    </li> 
	    <li> Under the "New Lines" tab, select "at end of file"
	    </li>
	    <li> Under the "Line Wrapping" tab, change "Maximum line width" to <code>80</code>.  This is done so that software can be printed for code reviews.
	    </li>
	    <li> Under the "Comments" tab,
	      <br/><b>unselect</b> "Enable Javadoc comment formatting" 
	      <br/><b>unselect</b> "Enable block comment formatting", otherwise the block comments that have &lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;pre&gt; get changed.
	      <br/><b>unselect</b> "Enable line comment formatting", otherwise the headers for public methods etc. get changed.
	    </li>
	    <li> Click OK.
	    </li>
	    <li> In the Preferences Window, click Apply.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</li>

	<li> Eclipse has very good compiler error/warning.
	  We turn off a some warnings about Generic Types:
	  <ol>
	    <li> While still in the preferences window
	      <br/> (<code>Eclipse</code> | <code>Preferences</code>)
	      <br/>  Expand <code>Java</code> | <code>Compiler</code> | <code>Errors/Warning</code>
	    </li>
	    <li> Under "Generic Types", change
	      "Unchecked generic type operation" to "Ignore".
	    </li>
	    <li> Under "Generic Types", change
	      "Usage of a raw type" to "Ignore".
	    </li>
	    <li> Click Apply.  If you are prompted for a full rebuild, click Yes.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li> Click Apply and Close  in the Preferences window to apply all of the above changes.
	</li>
	<li>Proceed to the next step, <a href="project.htm">Setting up the ptII project</a>
	</li>
      </ol>
