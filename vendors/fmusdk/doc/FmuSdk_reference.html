  <h1>FMU SDK 1.0.2</h1>
  The FMU SDK is a free software development kit provided by
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de" target="_blank">QTronic</a>.
    The FMU SDK demonstrates basic use of Functional Mockup Units (FMUs)
    as defined by the following specifications
    <ul>
    <li>Functional Mock-up Interface for <a href=
    "http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/specifications/FMI_for_ModelExchange_v1.0.pdf" 
    target="_blank">Model Exchange 1.0</a> (January 26, 2010)</li>
    <li>Functional Mock-up Interface for <a href=
    "http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/specifications/FMI_for_CoSimulation_v1.0.pdf" 
    target="_blank">Co-Simulation 1.0</a> (October 12, 2010)</li>
    </ul>
    The FMI specifications are available from 
    <a href="http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/fmi.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    A short overview on FMUs and the FMI specification can be found
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmi_overview.pdf" taget="_blank">here</a>.
    The FMU SDK can also serve as starting point for developing applications 
    that create or process FMUs.
    <p>
    The FMU SDK contains the C sources for various discrete and continuous 
    FMU models, a batch file for compiling and zip'ing these models, 
    an XML parser for parsing the model description of an FMU and two simple 
    simulation programs that run a given FMU and output the result as CSV file.
    <p>
    The FMU SDK can be downloaded from 
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip">
        http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip</a>. 
    For bug reports, questions or comments regarding the FMU SDK, please
    mail to <a href="mailto:fmu@qtronic.de">fmu@qtronic.de</a>.

<h2><a name="installation">Building and Installing the FMU SDK</a></h2>
Downwload the FMU SDK from <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip">here</a>, 
and unzip in a directory where you have write access. 
That directory is called FMUSDK_HOME below and may contain white space, such as in "C:\Program Files\fmusdk". 
The FMU SDK contains only the C sources of the FMUs and the simulator, not the executables, 
and should compile on all Windows platforms.
<p/>
To build the FMUs and the simulator, double click on FMUSDK_HOME\src\build_all.bat.
This should create fmu files in FMUSDK_HOME\fmu\me and FMUSDK_HOME\fmu\cs, as well as two
simulators fmusim_me.exe and fmusim_cs.exe in FMUSDK_HOME\bin. 
Compilation using build_all.bat requires that you have installed 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (VS8) or 2008 (VS9), for example the free Express Edition. 
To compile with another compiler, adapt file build_all.bat.
<hr />
<h2><a name="simulation">Simulating an FMU</a></h2>
To run a given FMU, open a command shell in directory FMUSDK_HOME and run the command fmusim
<pre>
fmusim fmi model.fmu tEnd h loggingOn csvSeparator
  fmi ........... cs for co-simulation or me for model exchange, required
  model.fmu ..... path to FMU, relative to current dir or absolute, required
  tEnd .......... end  time of simulation, optional, defaults to 1.0 sec
  h ............. step size of simulation, optional, defaults to 0.1 sec
  loggingOn ..... 1 to activate logging,   optional, defaults to 0
  csvSeparator .. c for comma, s for semicolon, optional, defaults to c
</pre>
This unzips the given FMU, parses the contained modelDescription.xml file, simulates
the FMU from t=0 to t=tEnd, and writes the solution to file 'result.csv'. The file
is written in CSV format (comma-separated values), using ';' to separate columns and
using ',' instead of '.' as decimal dot to print floating-point numbers.
To change the result file format, use the 'csv separator' option.
The logging option activates logging of the simulated FMU. The FMI specification does
not specify, what exactly to log in this case. However, when logging is switched on,
the sample FMUs of the FMU SDK log every single FMU function call. Moreover, the
fmusim simulators logs every step and every event that is detected.
<p/>
Example command:
<pre>
&gt; fmusim me fmu/me/bouncingBall.fmu 5 0.1 0 s
FMU Simulator: run 'fmu/bouncingBall.fmu' from t=0..5 with step size h=0.1, loggingOn=0, csv separator=';'
Simulation from 0 to 5 terminated successful
  steps ............ 51
  fixed step size .. 0.1
  time events ...... 0
  state events ..... 14
  step events ...... 0
CSV file 'result.csv' written
</pre>
To plot the result file, open it e.g. in a spread-sheet program, such as Miscrosoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc.
The figure below shows the result of the above simulation when plotted using OpenOffice Calc 3.0.
Note that the height h of the bouncing ball as computed by fmusim becomes negative at the contact points, 
while the true solution of the FMU does actually not contain negative height values. 
This is not a limitation of the FMU, but of fmusim_me, which does not attempt to locate the 
exact time of state events. 
To improve this, either reduce the step size or add your own procedure for state-event location to fmusim_me.

<h2><a name="creating_fmus">Creating your own FMUs</a></h2>
The FMU SDK contains a few sample FMUs
<ul>
    <li><a href="../src/models/dq/_main.html">dq</a> the Dahlquist test function x = -k der(x)</li>
    <li><a href="../src/models/inc/_main.html">inc</a> increments an integer counter every second</li>
    <li><a href="../src/models/values/_main.html">values</a> demonstrates the use of all scalar FMU data types</li>
    <li><a href="../src/models/vanDerPol/_main.html">vanDerPol</a> ODE with 2 continuous states</li>
    <li><a href="../src/models/bouncingBall/_main.html">bouncingBall</a> a bouncing ball that defines state events</li>
</ul>
To implement your own FMU using the FMU SDK, create a directory - say xy - in FMUSDK_HOME\src\models, and create
files modelDescription.xml and xy.c there.
The names of the new directory and the .c file must be the same. The content of the .c file should 
follow the existing FMU examples, see the comments in the example code. 
The XML file must not contain the <code>&lt;implementation&gt;</code>
element and the closing <code>&lt/fmiModelDescription&gt;</code> tag, because this is added automatically during build.
When done with editing the xml file and xy.c, open a command shell in FMUSDK_HOME\src\model and run the 
command <code>build_fmu me xy</code> to build an FMU for model exchange, or <code>build_fmu cs xy</code> to build an FMU for co-simulation. 
This should create the FMU file xy.fmu in directory FMUSDK_HOME\fmu\me or FMUSDK_HOME\fmu\cs.
<p>
The figure below might help to create or process the XML file modelDescription.xml. 
It shows all XML elements (without attributes) used in the schema files (XSD) for 
model exchange and co-simulation. Notation: UML class diagram.
