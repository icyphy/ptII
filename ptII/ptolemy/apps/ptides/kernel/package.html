The PTIDES (Programming Temporally Integrated
Distributed Embedded Systems) kernel.

<p>PTIDES leverages time synchronization
over distributed platforms. PTIDES uses discrete-event (DE) models as
programming specifications for distributed real-time systems and
extends discrete-event models with the capability of mapping certain
events to physical time. We use model time to define execution
semantics and add constraints that bind certain model time events to
physical time. We limit the relationship of model time to physical
time to only those circumstances where this relationship is needed. An
execution model that permits out of order processing of events without
sacrificing determinacy and without requiring backtracking is
described in. The formal foundation is based on the concepts of
relevant dependency and relevant order.
