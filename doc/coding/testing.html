<h1><A NAME="Testing Ptolemy II">Testing Ptolemy II</A></h1>
<HR>
This page is primarily for Ptolemy II Developers.  Some of the commands
mentioned below are not included in the Ptolemy II distribution.

 <P>Contents:
<MENU>
<LI> <A HREF="#test suite">Test Suite</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#testing java">Testing Java</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#testing documentation">Testing Documentation</A>
</MENU>

<H2><A NAME="test suite">Test Suite</A></H2>

We have included regression tests for most of the Ptolemy IIcode.  Usually, 
wherever there is Java file, the tests are in the <CODE>test</CODE>
directory.

<H3>Running the tests</H3>
The tests themselves are written in Tcl, and use
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/java/tclblend">Tcl Blend</a>,
which is an interface between Tcl and Java.

 <p>To run the tests, you must have Tcl Blend installed.
 <p><CODE>make tests</CODE> will run the tests in the current directory
and any subdirectories.

<H3>Writing your own tests</H3>

The test suite infrastructure is based on the Tcl test suite code.  The 

 <P>The file <A HREF="../../util/testsuite/testDefs.tcl"><CODE>$PTII/util/testsuite/testDefs.tcl</CODE></A> defines the Tcl proc <CODE>test</CODE>.

 <P><CODE>test</CODE> takes four arguments:
<OL>
<LI> The name of the test, for example: <CODE>foo-1.0</CODE>
  <br> The name of the test should strictly follow the format below.
	The Tcl tests that come with the Tcl distribution follow a similar
	format, so unless there is a strong need to not follow the format,
	please stick with what works.
	<MENU>
	<LI> The first part of
	name of the test should reflect the command that is
	being tested.  

	<LI> The test number should be separated by a dash '<CODE>-</CODE>'

	<LI> Each test number consists of a major value and a minor value,
	separated by a dot.  Usually the major value changes as different
	parts of the command are being tested.  The minor value changes
	for different tests for the particular part of the command under test.

	<LI> Test numbers usually start with <CODE>1</CODE>, though if
	you are
	doing setup, you can start with <CODE>0</CODE>.

	<LI> If you go back later and want to stick a test in between
	<CODE>foo-1</CODE> and <CODE>foo-2</CODE>, you can always call
	your new test <CODE>foo-1.1</CODE>
	</MENU>


<LI> The test description, usually a single sentence.

<LI> The contents of the test, usually Tcl code that does the action to
be tested.  The last line of the contents should return a value.

<LI> The results to be compared against.
</OL>

Below is a sample piece of code that sources the
<CODE>testDefs.tcl</CODE> file and then runs one test.  The code below
has the incorrect value return results to be compared against, so the
test suite properly indicates that the test failed.

<tcl><pre>
if {[string compare test [info procs test]] == 1} then { 
    source [file join $PTII util testsuite testDefs.tcl]
} {}
test testExample-1.1 {This is the first test example, it does very little} {
	catch {this is an error} errMsg1
	set a "this is the value of a"
	list $errMsg1 $a
} {{invalid command name "this"} {this is NOT the value of a}}
</pre></tcl>

<H3>Parts of a test file</H3>
Test files should be located in the <CODE>test</CODE> directory.

 <P>It is better to have many small test files as opposed to a few
large test files so that other developers can quickly find the tests
for the class they are working with.  Usually tests for the class
<CODE>Foo</CODE> are found in the file <CODE>test/testFoo.itcl</CODE>

 <P>Each test file should have the following parts:
<OL>

<LI> The name of the test file should begin with the word <CODE>test</CODE>.
For example, if we were testing the Tcl <CODE>foo</CODE> command, then
the file would be named <CODE>testFoo.itcl</CODE>.  The extension of the file
is either <CODE>.tcl</CODE> or <CODE>.itcl</CODE>:
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>.tcl</CODE> if the file can be sourced in a <CODE>tclsh</CODE>
	that does not contain Itcl.
	<CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/testPath.tcl</CODE> is an example.

<LI> <CODE>.itcl</CODE> if the file contains Itcl constructs or tests
	Itcl classes. 
</MENU>
Most of the tests are <CODE>.itcl</CODE> files.

<LI> The Copyright

<LI> The code that loads the test system package
<PRE>
package require tycho.util.tytest
</PRE>


<LI> A line that the user can uncomment if they want the test system to
produce verbose messages:
<PRE>
#set VERBOSE 1
</PRE>


<LI> The individual tests, which should loosely follow the Tycho 
file format standard:
<PRE>
############################################################################
#### Foo
test Foo-1.1 {Test out Foo} {

} {}
</PRE>

</OL>

<H3><A NAME="test styles">Test Styles</A></H3>
There are two types of tests:
<OL>
<LI> Tests that handle all necessary setup in each individual test.

<LI> Tests that rely on the earlier tests to do setup.
</OL>

In general, each test file should be able to be run over and over again
in a binary without exiting the binary (it should be idempotent).  

 <P>It is up to the author of the tests as to whether each individual
test does all the set up necessary.  If each test is atomic, then it
makes it easy to highlight the text of an individual test and run it.
If lots of tests are sharing common setup, then using a separate
procedure to do setup might help.  On the negative side, atomic tests
usually are longer and have more complicated return results.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="testing java">Testing Java</A></H2>

Tcl Blend is Sun's Tcl/Java interface.  We use Tcl Blend to test Java
by writing Tcl code that exercises the Java classes.

<H3>Running the tests</H3>
If you run <CODE>make</CODE> in a test directory that contains 
tests written in Tcl for testing Java classes, then the 'right thing'
should just happen.  The Java testbed does have a few differences:
<DL>
<DT> The <CODE>make test_jsimple</CODE> rule
<DD> This rule will run only the Java tests in a <CODE>tclsh</CODE> binary
that can load the Tcl Blend extension

<DT> The <CODE>alljtests.tcl</CODE> file
<DD> This file will run all the Java tests that require Tcl Blend.
The reason we have yet another file is that Tcl Blend will not necessarily
work on all platforms, and we want to be able to run the non-Tcl Blend
tests on those platforms.

</DL>


<H3>Writing Tests for Java </H3>
Below we discuss some of the details of writing tests in Tcl that test
Java classes.
<H4>Simple Example</H4>
<p>Tcl Blend allows us to instantiate objects in a class and call public
methods.  We use Tcl Blend and the standard Tcl test bed to create tests.
In the example below, we call <CODE>java::new</CODE> to create an
instance of the Java <CODE>NamedObj</CODE> class.  We can then
call public methods of <CODE>NamedObj</CODE> by referring to the 
Java object handle <CODE>$n</CODE>:
<PRE>
test NamedObj-2.1 {Create a NamedObj, set the name, change it} {
    set n [java::new pt.kernel.NamedObj]
    set result1 [$n getName]
    $n setName "A Named Obj"
    set result2 [$n getName]
    list $result1 $result2
} {{} {A Named Obj}}
</PRE>

<H4>Java Tcl Test Files</H4>
It is best if each Java class has a separate Tcl file that contains tests.
The base of the name of the Tcl test file should be the same of the Java
class being tested.  The Tcl test file should be located in the
<CODE>test</CODE> subdirectory of the directory where the Java class
is defined.
 <P>For example, if we are testing <CODE>NamedObj.java</CODE>, then
the Tcl test file should be at <CODE>test/NamedObj.tcl</CODE>.

<H4><A NAME="getJavaInfo testing proc">getJavaInfo Testing Proc</A></H4>
 <P>Tcl Blend provides a Tcl procedure called <CODE>java::info</CODE>
which returns information about an instance of a Java class.  
<A HREF="../../kernel/gui/test/testDefs.tcl"><CODE>$TYCHO/kernel/gui/test/testDefs.tcl</CODE></A>
defines the <CODE>getJavaInfo</CODE> Tcl proc, which takes a Java object
handle and returns a string that describes the object's fields, methods
constructors, and superclass.
 <P>Each Java class should have a Tcl test that calls <CODE>getJavaInfo</CODE>
so that if the Java class definition changes, then the test will fail.
This will hopefully prompt the developer to write a test for the
changed feature.
 <P>If a test fails because of changes in the values returned by
<CODE>getJavaInfo</CODE>, then the way to fix the test is to run 
the test and grab the strings actually returned and substitute it back
into the test file.  Of course, you should write tests that cover any 
changes reported by <CODE>getJavaInfo</CODE>.


<H3><A NAME="JavaScope">JavaScope</A></H3>
<A HREF="http://www.suntest.com/JavaScope">JavaScope</A> is Sun's
Java code coverage tool.  
 <P>Here's how to review the test suite code coverage:
<OL>

<LI> Run:
<PRE>
cd $TYCHO/java/pt/kernel
make jsall
</PRE>
The <CODE>jsall</CODE> makefile rule does the following:
<MENU>
<LI> JavaScope uses a program called <CODE>jsinstr</CODE>
to instrument the Java files.  <CODE>jsinstr</CODE> copies the
original files to the <CODE>jsoriginal</CODE> directory and then
adds Java function calls to copies of the files.  These function calls
increment counters in a database at runtime.

<LI> To compile the instrumented classes the <CODE>JavaScope.zip</CODE> file
is added to the CLASSPATH and then the classes are recompiled.

<LI> The test suite is run.
</MENU>

<LI> To views the code coverage run either <CODE>jsreport</CODE>
or <CODE>javascope</CODE>
<PRE>
jsreport -dbsummary
</PRE>

<LI> To restore the files
back to the original state, run <CODE>make jsrestore</CODE>.
<PRE>
make jsrestore
</PRE>

</OL>
<H4>JavaScope Details</H4>
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>jsinstr</CODE> saves the original Java files to the 
<CODE>jsoriginal</CODE> directory.  The <CODE>jsall</CODE> makefile
rule checks to see if this directory is present, and if it is not, runs 
<CODE>jsinstr</CODE>.  The <CODE>jsrestore</CODE> rule runs
<CODE>jsrestore</CODE> and then attempts to remove the <CODE>jsoriginal</CODE>
directory so that the next run of the <CODE>jsall</CODE> rule will
recreate it.  If you are running <CODE>jsinstr</CODE> by hand on files
that are not in the makefile, then you may find it necessary clean out the
<CODE>jsoriginal</CODE> directory with:
<PRE>
jsrestore *.java
rm jsoriginal/README
rmdir jsoriginal
</PRE>


<LI> Javascript writes the code coverage information to
<CODE>~/jsdatabase</CODE>.  You might find it helpful to remove
this directory periodically.

</MENU>


<H4>Flushing the JavaScope database</H4>
The JavaScope database must be flushed by hand at the end of a run, or the
code coverage data of the run will not be dumped out to disk.
 <P>There are two ways to do this.
<OL>

<LI> The <CODE>IFLUSHCLASS</CODE> option will flush out the coverage
information for the current class at the end of each method.

<LI> The <CODE>IFLUSH</CODE> option will flush out all the coverage
information at the end of each method.

</OL>
Obviously, using <CODE>IFLUSH</CODE> will take more time than using 
<CODE>IFLUSHCLASS</CODE>.

 <P>The <CODE>jsintr</CODE> options are set by consulting the following
resources in order.
<OL>
<LI> system properties - environment variables 

<LI> <CODE>$HOME/javascope.properties</CODE>

<LI> <CODE>./javascope.properties</CODE> in the current directory.

<LI> Options can be embedded in files as comments:
<PRE>
/*jsoptions: ...*/
</PRE>
Embedded comment options can be set more than once in a file.  Embedded
comment options are in effect until is the option is changed by another
embedded comment option.

<LI>  Command line arguments to <CODE>jsinstr</CODE>.

</OL>

See the <A HREF="http://www.suntest.com/JavaScope/jsinstr.html"><CODE>jsinstr</CODE></A> documentation for details.

I tried to use Tcl Blend to call a dummy Java method that flushes the
database using an embedded comment, and then call that method before
exiting.

 <P>Here's how I attempted to flush the database using a dummy Java method.
 <P>I created the <CODE>JavaScopeFlush</CODE> class:
<PRE>
public class JavaScopeFlush {
    /*jsoptions:IFLUSH=true*/
    public static void flush() {
    }
    /*jsoptions:IFLUSH=false*/
}
</PRE>
 <P>Ran <CODE>jsinstr</CODE> on <CODE>JavaScopeFlush.java</CODE>

 <P>I then tried to call this method with:
<PRE>
java::call JavaScopeFlush flush
</PRE>
Unfortunately, it looks like embedded comments are broken.
 <P>For more information, see the 
<A HREF="http://www.suntest.com/NewJavaScope/faq.html#Q5">JavaScope FAQ</A>.


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="testing documentation">Testing Documentation</A></H2>

The Ptolemy II documentation is written in HTML.  There are several tools
that can be used.
<H3>weblint</H3>

Weblint tells the user about html errors.  Weblint can be obtained
from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cre.canon.co.uk/pub/weblint/weblint.tar.gz"><CODE>ftp://ftp.cre.canon.co.uk/pub/weblint/weblint.tar.gz</CODE></A>
To run <CODE>weblint</CODE>:
<PRE>
cd $PTII
make weblint
</PRE>

<H3>htmlchek</H3>

Htmlchek is another tool that tells the user about html errors.
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> also checks for bad links.  The
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> output is a little hard to read, so we tend to
use <CODE>weblint</CODE> for checking individual files.
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> can be obtained from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/htmlchek/"><CODE>ftp://ftp.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/htmlchek/</CODE></A>

<P> The best way to run <CODE>htmlchek</CODE> is to create a sample
distribution, create the files in the <CODE>codeDoc</CODE> directory
and then run <CODE>htmlchek</CODE>

<OL>
<LI> Create the test distribution:
<PRE>
cd /users/ptdesign/adm/gen-latest; make htmlchek
</PRE>

<LI> Reset <CODE>TYCHO</CODE> to point to the test distribution:
<PRE>
setenv TYCHO /users/ptdesign/adm/dists/tycho-latest
cd $TYCHO
</PRE>

<LI> Run <CODE>make install</CODE>.  This will make the Itcl HTML docs
twice, which will populate the <CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> directories.
You need to make the Itcl HTML docs twice so that the cross references are
correct.

<LI> Run <CODE>make htmlchek</CODE>

</OL>



The output ends up in five files
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.ERR</CODE> - HTML usage errors
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.NAME</CODE> - Locations in the specified files
that ware not referenced by any of those files
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> - References from the specified files
that are not found in the files.  This file is by far the most important
file to look at.
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.SRC</CODE> - References to online images.
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.MAP</CODE> - Cross dependency information.
</MENU>

<P> All of the references in <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> that point
to <CODE>.html</CODE> files should be checked.  References to non-HTML
files appear in <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> because the non-HTML
files were not included in the list of files that
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> ran on.  One quick way to search all the the <CODE>*.html</CODE> files is
<PRE>
cd $TYCHO
grep mystring `find . -name "*.html" -print`
</PRE>

<H3>Spellchecking</H3>
Checking the spelling in all the HTML files can be done with:
<PRE>
cd $TYCHO
spell `find . -name "*.html" -print`
</PRE>
You can spell check an individual HTML file by using the HTML
editor built-in spell checker under the <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu.

<H3>Checking for bogus copyright SCCS keywords</H3>

Run <CODE>~ptdesign/adm/copyright/chkq $TYCHO</CODE> to print out
the names of files that might have bogus <CODE>&#37;Q&#37;</CODE> values.
 <P>
Then run <CODE>~ptdesign/adm/bin/sccsadmin</CODE> on each file that
has no value for <CODE>&#37;Q&#37;</CODE>
substituted in.

<H3>Check the distribution for bogus files</H3>
Run the following makefile rules and commands:
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>make realclean</CODE>

<DD> This will remove the <CODE>tclIndex</CODE> files and the files in
<CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE>.  The reason to remove the
<CODE>codeDoc</CODE> files is so that we don't ship HTML files for any
classes that have been removed.

<DT> <CODE>make install</CODE>
<DD> This will recreate the <CODE>tclIndex</CODE> files and the
<CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> files.

<DT> <CODE>make checkjunk</CODE>
<DD> Look for files in the distribution that should not be there.

<DT> <CODE>adm/bin/chkgifs</CODE>
<DD> This file looks for gif files that are not used by HTML files
in the distribution.
