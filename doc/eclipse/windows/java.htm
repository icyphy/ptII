    <h1>Windows: Installing Java</h1>
    Under Windows, the Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed from Oracle, see
    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html#in_browser" target="_top"><code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</code></a>.
    <p>Java is available as both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.  Deciding
      which one to download can be complex, see <a href="32bitVs64bit.htm">32-bit or 64-bit</a>.</p>

    <p>Java 11 (also known as Java 8) is preferred.

    <p><b>The development version available via git</b> is best built
      with Oracle Java 11 or later
      because the Accessors use Nashorn.  It is possible to build Ptolemy II
      with older versions of Java or with OpenJDK, but these configurations
      are not supported.
      It is possible to build the development version using Java 9 or Java 10, but
      Java 9 has not been tested with Eclipse and Ptolemy II.
    </p>

    <p>Ptolemy II 11.0 supported JDK 1.8, aka JDK 8.  In September, 2021, the development tree
  was updated to use the standalone Nashorn jar, which requires JDK 11 or later.
  See <a href="https://github.com/szegedi/nashorn/wiki/Using-Nashorn-with-different-Java-versions#in_browser" target="_top">Using Nashorn with different Java versions</a>.
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>In January, 2015, the core of development version can be
	build with Java 1.6 by running configure, but this is not
	supported or tested.  Over time, Java 1.6 is less likely to
	work.
      </p>

      <p>The full development version of Ptolemy II requires Java 1.7
	because particleFiltering uses type inference for generic instance
	creation and catches multiple exceptions.  Over time, more and
	more code will require Java 1.7 and Java 1.8.</p>
      
      <p>Note that the core of Ptolemy that is used by Kepler can be
	built with Java 1.7.  To use Java 1.7 would require excluding
	ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs and org/ptolemy/machineLearning.  The core
	of Ptolemy II is built using Java 1.7 on a nightly basis as part
	of the Kepler build.</p>

      <p>The development version of Ptolemy II requires Oracle Java 11 or later to use
	Nashorn in ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs and IntStream in
	org/ptolemy/machineLearning.
	The <code>$PTII/build.default.xml</code> works
	best with Java 11</p>

      <p>The Oracle (formerly Sun) Java Development Kit (JDK) is preferred.</p>  
      <p>The IBM JDK will work under Linux.</p>
      <p>OpenJDK may work with Ptolemy II, but could have problems with Kepler.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is a good idea to be sure that the JDK <code>bin/</code> directory is in your Windows Path.
      <ol>
        <li>Right click on My Computer, select Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables</li>
        <li>Under "System variables", scroll to the PATH line and click Edit ...</li>
        <li>Insert <code>c:\Program Files\Java\<i>jdk1.8.0_121</i>\bin;</code> at the start of the path. Note that <code><i>jdk1.8.0_121</i></code> should be updated to match the directory that was created by the installer. </li> 
      </ol>

    <p>After installing Java, then the next step is to <a href="eclipse.htm">install Eclipse</a>.
