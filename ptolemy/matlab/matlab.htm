This directory contains the Ptolemy II Matlab Interface for Windows
written by Zoltan Kemenczy of Research in Motion Limited.

<p>Christopher Hylands wrote the notes below, so any mistakes are his.

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Ptolemy II Matlab interfaces uses the Java Native Interface to
invoke the Matlab engine, evaluate Matlab expressions and return
the results to Ptolemy II.

The Matlab interface works only under Windows, and requires that Matlab
be installed on your local machine.

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>To use the Matlab interface,
 you must have ptmatlab.dll in your path, which is initially created in
this directory, and eventually moved to <code>$PTII/bin</code>.  It is best if
your path includes <code>$PTII/bin</code>.

<p>The Matlab interface also requires that <code>libeng.dll</code> be in your path.
<br><code>libeng.dll</code> is located in the <code>bin/win32</code>
subdirectory of Matlab.

You can either set your path permanently using the Control panel,
or set it temporarily in your current Bash shell.

 <p>Under Windows 2000, you set the path via
the Environment tab of the System control panel
(<CODE>Start Menu </CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Settings</CODE> -&gt;
<CODE>Control Panels</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>System</CODE> -&gt;
<CODE>Advanced</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Environment Variables</CODE>
 <p>Under Cygwin Bash, if your Ptolemy II installation was
at <CODE>c:/ptII</CODE>, then you might do
<pre>
PATH=/cygdrive/c/ptII/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

The Ptolemy II Matlab interface requires the GNU C compiler.

<p>Instructions about compiling
the Matlab interface can be found at
<code>$PTII/doc/install.htm</code></a>

<p>Below are instructions for building the interface at UC Berkeley:

<ol>
<li> Go to
   <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/#in_browser" target="_top"><code>http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</code></a>
   and install the Cygwin Setup tool

<li> Start up the Cygwin Setup tool and install
<pre>
    Basic
    Devel:	Needed for gcc
</pre>

<li> Install or mount the Matlab share.
   In the UC Berkeley EECS Department, the Matlab binary is at
   available as \\winsww\public\matlab\matlab-6.0\bin\win32\Matlab.exe
   <br>To mount this, bring up the Run window with:
      Start -> Run 
   <br>Type in \\winsww
   <br>Right click on sww, select 'Map Network Drive'
   <br>Click Finish

   <br>For me, this ended up on the e: drive

<li>Add the Matlab directory to your path.  You can either add it
   permanently to you path, or add it temporarily.
   If you are on a laptop, and the Matlab installation is a remote
   file system, you should mount it temporarily:
<pre>
   bash-2.05$ PATH=/cygdrive/e/public/matlab/matlab-6.0/bin/win32:$PATH
</pre>

<li> Verify that matlab is in your path
<pre>
   bash-2.05$ type matlab
   matlab is /cygdrive/e/public/matlab/matlab-6.0/bin/win32/matlab
</pre>

<li> Reconfigure Ptolemy II so that it knows that you now have matlab:
<pre>
   cd $PTII
   rm config.*
   ./configure
</pre>

<li> Build the Matlab interface
<pre>
   cd $PTII/ptolemy/matlab
   make
</pre>

<li> Run a test:
<pre>
   vergil "$PTII/ptolemy/matlab/demo/MatlabExpression/MatlabExpression.xml" 
</pre>
   Note that during the preinitialize phase there may be a delay while
   the Matlab engine starts up over the network.
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
Things to try:
<ul>
<li> Be sure that you can run Matlab by hand outside of
Ptolemy II using <CODE>Start</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Programs</CODE>
-&gt; <CODE>Matlab <I>N.N</I></CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Matlab <I>N.N</I></CODE>.
 <br>This will test that Matlab is properly installed on your machine
and that you have a license

<li> Be sure that ptmatlab.dll is in you path.
 <br>Under bash, try:
<pre>
type ptmatlab.dll
</pre>
You should get something like:
<pre>
ptmatlab.dll is /cygdrive/c/ptII/bin/ptmatlab.dll
</pre>
If <CODE>ptmatlab.dll</CODE> is not found, then set your path
and be sure to export PATH
<pre>
PATH=/cygdrive/c/ptII/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>

<li> It is better to start <CODE>vergil</CODE> and then
use <CODE>File</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Open</CODE> of a Matlab model
than it is to pass the Matlab model as a command line argument.
 <br>The reason is that the failure to load the Matlab
interface might result in errors and starting vergil with
a Matlab model as a command line may result in the error message
being hidden.
