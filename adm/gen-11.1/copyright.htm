    &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

    &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

    &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

    &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

    &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

    Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Microstar's Java-Based XML Parser

Home Page: http://www.microstar.com/XML/

AElfred is free for both commercial and non-commercial use and

retained intact.  You are free to modify AElfred for your own use and
to redistribute AElfred with your modifications, provided that the

DISCLAIMER
----------

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  Please use it AT
YOUR OWN RISK.


** NEWS **
----------

Version 1.2a:

- AElfred has a new maintainer.  Side-effects of this will include
  a gradual change in the indenting style of the source code, a
  mixture of Unix and MSDOS-style text files, and other things that
  people who actually use the source code will find annoying.
  
  The transition will be complete at the next numbered release.

- Source code directory tree has changed to reflect JDK 1.2 requirements.

- Other small tweaks to allow compilation under JDK 1.2.

- No longer crashes when reading longish files from a Reader.

- No longer hangs when syntax errors appear after the document element.

- aelfred.jar is no longer out of date :-).

- XmlApp, the base class for the included demos, no longer extends Applet.
  The new class, XmlApplet, now works both as an applet and application
  like XmlApp used to.  JDK 1.2 beta 3 had problems with this behaviour --
  if an Applet was constructed (but not used) in an app, its finalization
  would hang the JVM.  This change will persist even after the JDK bug is
  fixed.
  
  The demos, therefore, no longer work as applets.

- Performance should be somewhat improved.

Version 1.2:

- AElfred can parse from an InputStream, Reader, or a system ID
- resolveEntity() can return an InputStream or Reader as well as a
  system ID
- new SAX driver for SAX 1.0gamma (http://www.megginson.com/SAX/)


DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-----------------

In most Java applets and applications, XML should not be the central
feature; instead, XML is the means to another end, such as loading
configuration information, reading meta-data, or parsing transactions.

When an XML parser is only a single component of a much larger
program, it cannot be large, slow, or resource-intensive.  With Java
applets, in particular, few programmers would be willing to require
users to download an additional 50K to 100K in class files just for
the sake of adding XML capability.

AElfred is a new Java-based XML parser from Microstar Software
Ltd. (http://www.microstar.com/), an established provider of XML and
SGML solutions.  AElfred is distributed for free (with full source) for
both commercial and non-commercial use, and is designed for easy and
efficient use over the Internet, based on the following principles:

1. AElfred must be as small as possible, so that it doesn't add too
   much to your applet's download time.

   STATUS: AElfred is currently about 26K in total.  The compressed
    JAR file, including the optional classes, is only 15K.

2. AElfred must use as few class files as possible, to minimize the number
   of HTTP connections necessary.

   STATUS: AElfred consists of only two core class files, the main
    parser class (XmlParser.class) and a small interface for your own
    program to implement (XmlHandler.class).  All other classes in
    the distribution are either optional or for demonstration only.

3. AElfred must be compatible with most or all Java implementations
   and platforms.

   STATUS: AElfred uses mainly JDK 1.0.2 features (you may parse from
    a JDK 1.1 Reader if you wish), and we have tested it successfully
    with the following Java implementations: JDK 1.1.1 (Linux), jview
    (Windows NT), Netscape 4 (Linux and Windows NT), Internet Explorer
    3 (Windows NT), and Internet Explorer 4 (Windows NT).

4. AElfred must use as little memory as possible, so that it does not take
   away resources from the rest of your program.

   STATUS: On a P75 Linux system, using JDK 1.1.1, running AElfred
    (with a 4MB XML document) takes only 2MB more memory than running
    a simple &quot;Hello world&quot; Java application.  Because AElfred does not
    build an in-memory parse tree, you can run it on very large input
    files using little or no extra memory.

5. AElfred must run as fast as possible, so that it does not slow down
   the rest of your program.

   STATUS: On a P75 Linux system, using JDK 1.1.1 (without a JIT
    compiler), AElfred parses test files at about 70K/second.  On a
    P166 NT workstation, using jview, AElfred parses test files at
    about about 1MB/second.

6. AElfred must produce correct output for well-formed and valid
   documents, but need not reject every document that is not valid or
   not well-formed.

   STATUS: AElfred is DTD-aware, and handles all current XML features,
    including CDATA and INCLUDE/IGNORE marked sections, internal and
    external entities, proper whitespace treatment in element content,
    and default attribute values.  It will sometimes accept input that
    is technically incorrect, however, without reporting an error (see
    below), since full error reporting would make the parser larger.

7. AElfred must provide full internationalisation from the first release.

   STATUS: AElfred supports Unicode to the fullest extent possible in
    Java.  It correctly handles XML documents encoded using UTF-8,
    UTF-16, ISO-10646-UCS-2, ISO-10646-UCS-4 (as far as surrogates
    allow), and ISO-8859-1 (ISO Latin 1/Windows).  With these
    character sets, AElfred can handle all of the world's major (and
    most of its minor) languages.  To support other character
    encodings, you can supply your own Reader.

As you can see from this list, AElfred is designed for production use,
not for validation: it will behave correctly with correct files, but
it will not necessarily let you know when there are errors.  If you
want to verify on your system that your XML document is valid or
well-formed before you publish it to the Internet, then you should use
a validating XML parser.


SAX
---

AElfred now has a SAX 1.0 (gamma) driver built-in to the main
distribution, so there is no need to use an external driver.  The
class name of the driver is

  com.microstar.xml.driver.SAXDriver

[Ptolemy Note:  We moved SAXDriver.java into the driver subdirectory
because 'make fast' runs javac *.java, which was causing problems
because SAXDriver uses SAX, which we do not ship]

STARTUP
-------

To test the parser, you can try one of the demonstration applications
EventDemo, TimerDemo, DtdDemo, or StreamDemo (see descriptions below).
To start an application, make certain that AElfred's classes are
somewhere on your CLASSPATH, then use a command line like the
following:

  java EventDemo <uri>

Where <uri> can be relative (i.e. a file in the current directory) or
absolute (i.e. an XML document anywhere on the Internet).  Note that
StreamDemo takes a file name rather than a URI.

XML parsers like AElfred read one or more source files (called
&quot;entities&quot;), and merge them into a single stream of logical events,
such as character data, processing instructions, or the start or end
of elements.  The EventDemo demonstration application gives you an
idea of what information appears in the stream.


PROGRAMMER'S USAGE
------------------

To use AElfred in your own Java applets or applications, you need to
supply a class that implements the com.microstar.xml.XmlHandler
interface (say, &quot;MyHandler&quot;), create a new com.microstar.xml.XmlParser
object (supplying the URI of the XML document), then explicitly start
a parse:

  import com.microstar.xml.XmlParser;

  [...]

  String uri = &quot;http://www.host.com/sample.xml&quot;;
  MyHandler handler = new MyHandler();
  XmlParser parser = new XmlParser();

  parser.setHandler(handler);
  parser.parse(uri, null, null);

During the parse, AElfred will call methods in your handler to report
events; for example, whenever a new element begins, it will call your
method

  void startElement(String name)

There are thirteen callback methods altogether in the XmlHandler
interface; for details, see HTML/com.microstar.xml.XmlHandler.html:

public void startDocument ();
public void endDocument ();
public String resolveEntity (String ename, String publicId, String systemId);
public String startExternalEntity (String systemId);
public String endExternalEntity (String systemId);
public void doctypeDecl (String dname, String publicId, String systemId);
public void attribute (String name, String value, boolean isSpecified);
public void startElement (String elname);
public void endElement (String elname);
public void charData (char ch[], int start, int length);
public void ignorableWhitespace (char ch[], int start, int length);
public void processingInstruction (String target, String data);
public void error (String message, String url, int line, int column);

If you want to avoid implementing all of these, you can derive your
handler from com.microstar.xml.HandlerBase (see below), then fill in
only the ones you need.


REQUIRED CLASSES
----------------

If you want to use the XML parser with a Java applet, these are the
only two classes that you must install (in addition to your own class
that implements the XmlHandler interface):

com/microstar/xml/XmlParser.class              
                        The actual XML parser.

com/microstar/xml/XmlHandler.class      
                        The callback interface for the XML parser.


OPTIONAL CLASSES
----------------

There are three optional classes that you may choose to install on a
web site (all are very small):

com/microstar/xml/XmlException.class
                        A convenience class for reporting XML
                        parsing errors.

com/microstar/xml/HandlerBase.class
                        (Requires XmlException.class.) A base class
                        that provides a default implementation for all
                        the handlers.

com/microstar/xml/driver/SAXDriver.class
                        A SAX driver for AElfred.

[Ptolemy Note:  We moved SAXDriver.java into the driver subdirectory
because 'make fast' runs javac *.java, which was causing problems
because SAXDriver uses SAX, which we do not ship]

Neither of the required classes refers to these, and you may leave
them out of a web installation if you do not need them.


DEMONSTRATION CLASSES
---------------------

The distribution also contains some classes for the demonstration
applications.  Normally, you will not include these in a web
installation:

XmlApp.class            A simple base class for the demonstrations.

EventDemo.class         (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
                        application showing the XML parse events.

TimerDemo.class         (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
                        application that simply parses a document
                        without producing any running output (except
                        for errors and warnings); useful for timing
                        the parser on different documents.

DtdDemo.class           (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
                        application that parses a document and prints
                        out a normalised version of the document's DTD
                        (if any).

StreamDemo.class        (Requires XmlApp.class.)  A demonstration
                        application that parses a document from an
                        input stream rather than a URL.


PARSER QUERY METHODS
--------------------

In addition to receiving callbacks, your XmlHandler object can send
queries about the DTD back to the XmlParser object.  The results of
these queries are not guaranteed complete until after your handler has
received a doctypeDecl() event (for details of these query methods,
see HTML/com.microstar.xml.XmlParser.html):

package com.microstar.xml.XmlParser;

public Enumeration declaredElements ()
public int getElementContentType (String elname)
public String getElementContentModel (String elname)

public Enumeration declaredAttributes (String elname)
public int getAttributeType (String elname, String aname)
public String getAttributeEnumeration (String elname, String aname)
public String getAttributeDefaultValue (String elname, String aname)
public String getAttributeExpandedValue (String elname, String aname)
public String getAttributeDefaultValueType (String elname, String aname)

public Enumeration declaredEntities ()
public int getEntityType (String ename)
public String getEntityPublicId (String ename)
public String getEntitySystemId (String ename)
public String getEntityValue (String ename)
public String getEntityNotationName (String ename)

public Enumeration declaredNotations ()
public String getNotationPublicId (String nname)
public String getNotationSystemId (String nname)


CHARACTER ENCODINGS
-------------------

** WARNING: AS REQUIRED BY THE XML SPECIFICATION, AELFRED ASSUMES THAT
            8-BIT CHARACTERS USE UTF-8 ENCODING UNLESS YOU PROVIDE AN
            ENCODING DECLARATION.  UTF-8 IS NOT THE SAME AS
            ISO-8859-1, SO 8-BIT ACCENTED CHARACTERS WILL CAUSE AN
            ERROR UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY DECLARE &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; AS YOUR
            ENCODING.

The AElfred parser currently supports all of the following input
encodings:

UTF-8                   The 8-bit Unicode transformation encoding.
UTF-16                  The 16-bit Unicode transformation encoding
                        (two octet orders).
ISO-10646-UCS-2         The standard 16-bit Unicode encoding (two
                        octet orders).
ISO-10646-UCS-4         The standard 32-bit Unicode encoding (four
                        octet orders).
ISO-8859-1              The 8-bit standard used in HTML and by Windows
                        and Unix.

If you need only 7-bit characters (i.e. ASCII), you can declare the
encoding as either &quot;UTF-8&quot; or &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;:

  ?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;

If you use ISO-8859-1, the parser will run slightly faster, since it
doesn't need to do any character transformation on input.  If you do
not declare an encoding, then the parser will (for 7- or 8-bit text)
default to UTF-8, which will work for ASCII but is slightly slower.

Since Java has only 16-bit characters, the parser does not resolve
surrogate pairs in UTF-16; as a result, UTF-16 and UCS-2 are currently
identical.


ERRORS AND WARNINGS
-------------------

AElfred should always produce correct output for valid and well-formed
XML documents.  Since AElfred is not a fully conforming XML parser,
however, it will sometimes accept documents that are not well-formed
or are not valid, without signaling an error.

For example, James Clark has a error-reporting test suite available at

  ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/test/xmltest.zip

These tests cover only well-formedness, not validity.  With the 1997
version of this package, out of 141 tests AElfred _failed_ to report
errors for 31 of them:

002.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
006.xml                 '--' in comment.
014.xml                 '' in attribute value
023.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
024.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
025.xml                 ']]&gt;' in PCDATA.
026.xml                 ']]&gt;' in PCDATA.
029.xml                 ']]&gt;' in PCDATA.
030.xml                 Illegal XML character (formfeed).
031.xml                 Illegal XML character (formfeed).
032.xml                 Illegal XML character (formfeed).
033.xml                 Illegal XML character (ESC).
034.xml                 Illegal XML character (formfeed).
038.xml                 Duplicate attribute assignment.
069.xml                 Missing space before 'NDATA'.
070.xml                 '--' in comment.
074.xml                 Element starting and ending in different entity.
086.xml                 '[' in public identifier.
087.xml                 '[' in public identifier.
088.xml                 ' ' in system literal.
089.xml                 NDATA parameter entity.
090.xml                 '' in attribute value.
091.xml                 NDATA parameter entity.
096.xml                 Missing space before 'encoding'.
100.xml                 Wrong case for standalone value.
104.xml                 Element begins and ends in different entities.
116.xml                 Reference begins and ends in different entities.
117.xml                 Reference begins and ends in different entities.
119.xml                 Reference begins and ends in different entities.
140.xml                 Illegal character at start of NAME.
141.xml                 Illegal character in NAME.

My experiments suggest that reporting all of these errors would add
10-15K to AElfred's size and slow down parsing by about 15 per cent.


ABOUT THE NAME &quot;AElfred&quot;
-----------------------

AElfred the Great (AElfred in ASCII) was king of Wessex, and at least
nominally of all England, at the time of his death in 899AD.  AElfred
introduced a wide-spread literacy program in the hope that his people
would learn to read English, at least, if Latin was too difficult for
them.  This AElfred hopes to bring another sort of literacy to Java,
using XML, at least, if full SGML is too difficult.

The initial &quot;AE&quot; (&quot;&#198;&quot; in ISO-8859-1) is also a reminder that XML is
not limited to ASCII.

          *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
          *
          *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
          *
          *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,

          *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

          *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
          *
          *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

          *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      The April tags accessor code uses code written by Edwin Olson

      These files are part of a modified subset of the april package created 
      by Professor Edward A. Lee (eal@eecs.berkeley.edu) that removes all 
      dependencies on external libraries and graphical classes and renames the 
      packages to follow Java naming conventions.

    <h2>
      License
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most of April is GPL'd, but we asked for and received a BSD license on 
      the Java april/tag code.

        I am okay with dual-licensing the Java code in april/tag and its 
        necessary dependencies under BSD clause license. (And since I'm 
        putting this in writing-- this does not extend to other software in 
        the april repository.) The specific license is included below for 
        reference, which includes an additional attribution clause versus the 
        one you sent.

      <p>
        That said, the java version is so ludicrously outperformed by the C 
        version that I'd really like to convince you to (somehow) use the C 
        version instead. It's not a C-versus-Java thing; the detector logic 
        itself is using completely new algorithms. It is also *much* cleaner 
        in terms of dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there some way to make the C version easier to use from Java? I'm 
        no fan of JNI either. Any ideas?

  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions:

  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating that You changed the files; and

  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
  the Derivative Works; and

  (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      &quot;G4LTL is a standalone tool and a Java library for automatically 
      generating controllers realizing linear temporal logic (LTL). The tool 
      is released under two versions, where the version shipped with Ptolemy 
      II is released under the Modified BSD license.&quot; G4LTL is developed by <a href="http://www.fortiss.org/en/home/" target="_top">fortiss 
      GmbH (An-Institut Technische Universit&#228;t M&#252;nchen)</a>.&#160;G4LTL 
      also has another version which allows to outperform the BSD version 
      (concerning synthesis time) by 10~50x. See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4ltl/#in_browser">http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4ltl/</a>

        </p>
        <p>
          (b) &quot;Licensed Unit&quot; means the unit of measure by which your use of 
          Software and/or Service is licensed, as described in your

          (c) &quot;Permitted Use&quot; means the licensed Software use(s) authorized in 
          this Agreement as specified in your Entitlement. The Permitted Use 
          for any bundled Sun software not specified in your Entitlement will 
          be evaluation use as provided in Section 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) &quot;Service&quot; means the service(s) that Sun or its delegate will 
          provide, if any, as selected in your Entitlement and as further

          2. License Grant and Entitlement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to the terms of your Entitlement, Sun grants you a 
          nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use Software for 
          its Permitted Use for the license term. Your Entitlement will 
          specify (a) Software licensed, (b) the Permitted Use, (c) the 
          license term, and (d) the Licensed Units.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, if your Entitlement includes Services, then it will 
          also specify the (e) Service and (f) service term.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your rights to Software or Services are limited in duration and 
          the date such rights begin is other than the purchase date, your 
          Entitlement will provide that beginning date(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Entitlement may be delivered to you in various ways depending on 
          the manner in which you obtain Software and Services, for example, 
          the Entitlement may be provided in your receipt, invoice or your 
          contract with Sun or authorized Sun reseller. It may also be in 
          electronic format if you download Software.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Permitted Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          As selected in your Entitlement, one or more of the following 
          Permitted Uses will apply to your use of Software. Unless you have 
          an Entitlement that expressly permits it, you may not use Software 
          for any of the other Permitted Uses. If you don't have an 
          Entitlement, or if your Entitlement doesn't cover additional 
          software delivered to you, then such software is for your Evaluation 
          Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Evaluation Use. You may evaluate Software internally for a 
          period of 90 days from your first use.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Research and Instructional Use. You may use Software internally 
          to design, develop and test, and also to provide instruction on such 
          uses.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Individual Use. You may use Software internally for personal, 
          individual use.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Commercial Use. You may use Software internally for your own 
          commercial purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) Service Provider Use. You may make Software functionality 
          accessible (but not by providing Software itself or through 
          outsourcing services) to your end users in an extranet deployment, 
          but not to your affiliated companies or to government agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Licensed Units.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Permitted Use is limited to the number of Licensed Units stated 
          in your Entitlement. If you require additional Licensed Units, you 
          will need additional Entitlement(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) The copies of Software provided to you under this Agreement is 
          licensed, not sold, to you by Sun. Sun reserves all rights not 
          expressly granted. (b) You may make a single archival copy of 
          Software, but otherwise may not copy, modify, or distribute 
          Software. However if the Sun documentation accompanying Software 
          lists specific portions of Software, such as header files, class 
          libraries, reference source code, and/or redistributable files, that 
          may be handled differently, you may do so only as provided in the 
          Sun documentation. (c) You may not rent, lease, lend or encumber 
          Software. (d) Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, 
          you may not decompile, or reverse engineer Software. (e) The terms 
          and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any Software updates, 
          provided to you at Sun's discretion, that replace and/or supplement 
          the original Software, unless such update contains a separate 
          license. (f) You may not publish or provide the results of any 
          benchmark or comparison tests run on Software to any third party 
          without the prior written consent of Sun. (g) Software is 
          confidential and copyrighted. (h) Unless otherwise specified, if 
          Software is delivered with embedded or bundled software that enables 
          functionality of Software, you may not use such software on a 
          stand-alone basis or use any portion of such software to 
          interoperate with any program(s) other than Software. (i) Software 
          may contain programs that perform automated collection of system 
          data and/or automated software updating services. System data 
          collected through such programs may be used by Sun, its 
          subcontractors, and its service delivery partners for the purpose of 
          providing you with remote system services and/or improving Sun's 
          software and systems. (j) Software is not designed, licensed or 
          intended for use in the design, construction, operation or 
          maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun and its licensors 
          disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses. 
          (k) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service 
          mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under 
          this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Java Compatibility and Open Source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional 
          classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under 
          compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement 
          available at www.java.net.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source 
          developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions 
          and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many 
          of its products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices 
          and open source licenses from such communities and third parties 
          that govern the use of those portions, and any licenses granted 
          hereunder do not alter any rights and obligations you may have under 
          such open source licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and 
          limitation of liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to 
          all Software in this distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Term and Termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). 
          Your rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without 
          notice from Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in 
          derogation of Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun 
          may terminate this Agreement should any Software become, or in Sun's 
          reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a claim of 
          intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. 
          Upon termination, you will cease use of, and destroy, Software and 
          confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 
          will survive termination of the Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Limited Warranty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
          purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which 
          Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials 
          and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software 
          is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;. Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire 
          liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to 
          replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some 
          states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
          the above may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you 
          specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from state to 
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        </p>
        <p>
          UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
          CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED 
          WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
          NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE 
          DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Limitation of Liability.
        </p>
        <p>
          TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
          LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR 
          SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, 
          HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF 
          OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN 
          HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event 
          will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including 
          negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for 
          Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply 
          even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. 
          Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or 
          consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
          applicable to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Export Regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials 
          delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control 
          laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other 
          countries. You agree to comply strictly with these laws and 
          regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to 
          obtain any licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be 
          required after delivery to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government 
          or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any 
          tier), then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying 
          documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is 
          in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for 
          Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 
          12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).
        </p>
        <p>
          13. Governing Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California 
          law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any 
          jurisdiction will apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. Severability.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this 
          Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
          omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case 
          this Agreement will immediately terminate.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. Integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, 
          is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject 
          matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written 
          communications, proposals, representations and warranties and 
          prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, 
          order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties 
          relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No 
          modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing 
          and signed by an authorized representative of each party.
        </p>
        <p>

            Most of the JavaMail source code is licensed under the CDDL

            license information at the top of each source file.

          <li>
            The source code for the demo programs is licensed under the BSD 
            license; again, the license is in each source file.
          </li>
          <li>
            The binary jar files published to the Maven repository are 
            licensed under the same CDDL and GPLv2+CE licenses as the 
            corresponding source code; see the file <code>META-INF/LICENSE.txt</code> 
            in each jar file.

    modification of the contents of a file containing Original
    Software or previous Modifications;

    B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Software or
    previous Modification; or

    C. Any new file that is contributed or otherwise made available
    under the terms of this License.

    1.10. &#8220;Original Software&#8221; means the Source Code and Executable
    form of computer software code that is originally released under
    this License.

    1.11. &#8220;Patent Claims&#8221; means any patent claim(s), now owned or
    hereafter acquired, including without limitation, method, process,
    and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by grantor.

    1.12. &#8220;Source Code&#8221; means (a) the common form of computer software
    code in which modifications are made and (b) associated
    documentation included in or with such code.

    1.13. &#8220;You&#8221; (or &#8220;Your&#8221;) means an individual or a legal entity
    exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of,
    this License. For legal entities, &#8220;You&#8221; includes any entity which
    controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
    You. For purposes of this definition, &#8220;control&#8221; means (a) the
    power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
    such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of
    more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or
    beneficial ownership of such entity.

    2. License Grants.

    2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.

    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
    subject to third party intellectual property claims, the Initial
    Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license:

    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
    trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,
    modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
    Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling
    of Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and
    offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software
    (or portions thereof).

    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective
    on the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes
    the Original Software available to a third party under the terms
    of this License.

    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
    granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software,
    or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the
    Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original
    Software with other software or devices.

    2.2. Contributor Grant.

    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
    subject to third party intellectual property claims, each
    Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license:

    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
    trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,
    display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
    created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an
    unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software
    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
    of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
    combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,
    and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that
    Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of
    Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
    Version (or portions of such combination).

    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
    effective on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise
    makes the Modifications available to a third party.

    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
    granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
    Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third
    party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the
    combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other
    software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other
    devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software
    in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
    available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
    Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
    the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License
    with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software
    You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
    recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to
    how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
    software exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
    License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
    remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
    contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
    or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
    the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
    of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may
    choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
    must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
    under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
    Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
    Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
    such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
    other code not governed by the terms of this License and
    distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
    You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
    for the Covered Software.

    4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised
    and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
    version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as
    provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has
    the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
    License under which You originally received the Covered
    Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the
    Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
    otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the
    License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
    available under the terms of the version of the License under
    which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You
    may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of
    the License published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
    and remove any references to the name of the license steward
    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
    (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
    differ from this License.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &#8220;AS IS&#8221;
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
    COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
    WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
    ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
    DISCLAIMER.

    6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
    breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
    beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
    assert such claim is referred to as &#8220;Participant&#8221;) alleging that
    the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
    the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
    the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
    the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
    under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
    notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
    such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
    Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
    or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
    taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
    payment or license.

    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
    LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
    NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
    SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
    SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Software is a &#8220;commercial item,&#8221; as that term is
    defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &#8220;commercial
    computer software&#8221; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. &#167;
    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &#8220;commercial computer software
    documentation&#8221; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
    (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
    rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
    lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
    provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
    under this License.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
    by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
    if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
    conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
    in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
    for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
    reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the
    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
    of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
    against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
    that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
    States export administration regulations (and the export control
    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
    distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
    of liability.

    NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND
    DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)

    The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of
    the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law
    provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
    District of California and the state courts of the State of
    California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.



    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991

    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  59 Temple
    Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
    this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
    Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
    change free software--to make sure the software is free for all
    its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
    Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
    authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
    software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
    instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
    charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
    or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
    use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
    do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
    for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
    it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
    that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
    get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.

    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
    and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
    copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
    certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
    this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
    and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
    is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
    will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
    the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear
    that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
    licensed at all.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work which
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
    distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
    &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work
    based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative
    work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
    Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
    and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
    is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each
    licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
    not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
    of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
    Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
    the Program (independent of having been made by running the
    Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
    intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
    absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
    Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
    for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
    portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy
    and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
    Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
    conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
    Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
    Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
    works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
    apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
    works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
    whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
    the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
    for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
    and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
    contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
    intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
    derivative or collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
    Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
    a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
    other work under the scope of this License.

    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
    of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
    following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
    interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
    source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
    plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
    used to control compilation and installation of the
    executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
    distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
    (in either source or binary form) with the major components
    (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
    executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
    License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
    from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
    or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
    are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
    License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
    any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
    copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
    it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
    the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
    the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
    further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
    granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties to this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
    patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
    issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
    License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
    License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
    your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
    obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
    way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
    entirely from distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
    intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
    in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
    any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
    of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
    protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,
    which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have
    made generous contributions to the wide range of software
    distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide
    if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
    to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
    the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
    excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
    in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
    License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
    this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
    to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following
    the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
    version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
    does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
    any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
    free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
    status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
    the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
    DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
    OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
    MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
    LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
    INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
    OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
    OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
    greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this
    is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and
    change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
    effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
    have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full
    notice is found.

    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
    does.  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
    published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the
    License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
    General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
    02111-1307 USA

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
    mail.

    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
    this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to
    redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
    details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
    commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
    `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
    suits your program.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the
    program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
    James Hacker.

    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
    program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
    library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking
    proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you
    want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of
    this License.

    &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2

    Certain source files distributed by Oracle are subject to the
    following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version
    2, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular
    source file's header the words &quot;Oracle designates this particular
    file as subject to the &quot;Classpath&quot; exception as provided by Oracle
    in the License file that accompanied this code.&quot;

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
    is making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms
    and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover
    the whole combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
    you permission to link this library with independent modules to
    produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these
    independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
    executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also
    meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions
    of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module
    which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify
    this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
    library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish
    to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
&#12;
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
&#12;
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)

  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
&#12;
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
&#12;
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
&#12;
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
&#12;
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
&#12;
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
&#12;
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
&#12;
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line="#DEFAULT" to="#DEFAULT" give="#DEFAULT" the="#DEFAULT" library="#DEFAULT" s="#DEFAULT" name="#DEFAULT" and="#DEFAULT" a="#DEFAULT" brief="#DEFAULT" idea="#DEFAULT" of="#DEFAULT" what="#DEFAULT" it="#DEFAULT" does.="#DEFAULT">

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          <p>
            <span><font size="10pt">Commercial distributors of software may 
            accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, 
            business partners and the like. While this license is intended to 
            facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
            includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so 
            in a manner which does not create potential liability for other 
            Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in 
            a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial 
            Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other 
            Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, 
            damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, 
            lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against 
            the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or 
            omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
            distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
            obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property 
            infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor 
            must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of 
            such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, 
            and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and 
            any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor 
            may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</font></span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span><font size="10pt">For example, a Contributor might include 
            the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That 
            Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial 
            Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties 
            related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are 
            such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this 
            section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims 
            against the other Contributors related to those performance claims 
            and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to 
            pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay 
            those damages.</font></span>

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be 
          unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the 
          provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the 
          parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.

        <a id="SEC2">Preamble</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom 
        to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses 
        are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
        software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some 
        specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the 
        Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You 
        can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether 
        this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better 
        strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations 
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, 
        not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
        for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get 
        it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of 
        it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
        you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis 
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave 
        you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source 
        code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide 
        complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them 
        with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
        it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
        library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there 
        is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified 
        by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what 
        they have is not the original version, so that the original author's 
        reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced 
        by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of 
        any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
        effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
        restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that 
        any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be 
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the 
        ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and 
        is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use 
        this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
        libraries into non-free programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a 
        shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a 
        combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary 
        General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the 
        entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General 
        Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with 
        the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it 
        does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General 
        Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less 
        of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages 
        are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
        libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
        special circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to 
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it 
        becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must 
        be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free 
        library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this 
        case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
        software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
        programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of 
        free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in 
        non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
        operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating 
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 
        users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is 
        linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
        that program using a modified version of the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
        modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 
        &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The 
        former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must 
        be combined with the library in order to run.

      <h3>
        <a id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
        MODIFICATION</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software 
        library or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
        copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
        distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License 
        (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data 
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
        (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work 
        which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the 
        Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under 
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a 
        portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
        straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is 
        included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
        making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means 
        all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated 
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
        compilation and installation of the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 
        running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from 
        such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based 
        on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for 
        writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and 
        what the program that uses the Library does.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
        Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
        provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
        an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep 
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence 
        of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the 
        Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
        you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library 
        or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and 
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
        Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software 
          library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry 
          prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of 
          any change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be 
          licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
          License.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to 
          a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application 
          program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed 
          when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such 
          function or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
          whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          <p>
            (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has 
            a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the 
            application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
            application-supplied function or table used by this function must 
            be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square 
            root function must still compute square roots.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, 
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
        sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
        on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote 
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
        your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
        exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
        collective works based on the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 
        with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of 
        a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
        the scope of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
        General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
        Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
        License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public 
        License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version 
        than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has 
        appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do 
        not make any other change in these notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
        copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
        subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
        Library into a program that is not a library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a 
        portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
        executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided 
        that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from 
        a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
        code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the 
        source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
        source along with the object code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any 
        portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by 
        being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
        Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it 
        contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the 
        library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 
        6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file 
        that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
        derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
        Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be 
        linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The 
        threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
        layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions 
        (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is 
        unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. 
        (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
        will still fall under Section 6.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
        distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
        Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, 
        whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may 
        also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
        to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
        that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit 
        modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 
        engineering for debugging such modifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
        this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work 
        during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
        copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
        directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one 
        of these things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete 
          corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including 
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed 
          under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable 
          linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work 
          that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that 
          the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
          modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
          understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions 
          files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
          application to use the modified definitions.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for 
          linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses 
          at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
          executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
          the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
          version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
          made with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid 
          for at least three years, to give the same user the materials 
          specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the 
          cost of performing this distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by offering 
          access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
          copy the above specified materials from the same place.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a copy 
          of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for 
        reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, 
        the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is 
        normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
        which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
        the executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
        accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
        use both them and the Library together in an executable that you 
        distribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work 
        based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
        other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute 
        such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of 
        the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
        otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of 
          the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other 
          library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the 
          Sections above.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library 
          of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
          explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the 
          same work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
        or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
        or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate 
        your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
        copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
        licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since 
        you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to 
        modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These 
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based 
        on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do 
        so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
        modifying the Library or works based on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any 
        work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
        license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or 
        modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
        impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
        rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
        compliance by third parties with this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
        allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
        to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. 
        If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
        obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, 
        then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For 
        example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
        redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly 
        or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it 
        and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the 
        Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
        any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
        apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
        integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made 
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
        impose that choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
        restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
        this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in 
        or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
        and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
        time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
        version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 
        &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and 
        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
        the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a 
        license version number, you may choose any version ever published by 
        the Free Software Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library 
        into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
        incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. 
        For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
        write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
        for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
        the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
        promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.</strong> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
        THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
        APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT 
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
        LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR 
        A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
        PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE 
        DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
        CORRECTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>16.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
        AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
        MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL 
        OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
        THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
        RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
        FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF 
        SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
        DAMAGES.

        If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 
        possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that 
        everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting 
        redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms 
        of the ordinary General Public License).
      </p>
      <p>
        To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It 
        is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
        effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should 
        have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full 
        notice is found.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
&#12;
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
&#12;
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)

  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
&#12;
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
&#12;
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
&#12;
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
&#12;
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
&#12;
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
&#12;
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

        where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and

        'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
        Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are 
        separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the 
        Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative

        royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, 
        offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such 
        Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent 
        license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the 
        Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, 
        such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be 
        covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to 
        any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per

        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
        provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
        patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
        Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
        any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
        or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
        granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility 
        to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
        Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
        to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
        license set forth in this Agreement.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
        under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      </ul>
      <ul>
        b) its license agreement:
      </ul>
      <ul>
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      </ul>
      <ul>
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<font color="#0000ff" size="2"> 
        </font>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        
      </ul>
      <p>
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>
      <ul>
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </ul>
      <ul>
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
        Program.
      </ul>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        <font color="#0000ff" size="2">Contributors may not remove or alter 
        any copyright notices contained within the Program. </font>
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
        Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
        Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
        responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
        like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
        of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
        commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
        create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
        Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
        such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend 
        and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) 
        against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising 
        from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
        against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
        or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
        distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
        obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
        In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
        notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
        allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
        claim at its own expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
        product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
        Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
        claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
        claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
        alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
        defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
        performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
        Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
        must pay those damages.
      </p>

      <p>
        <font color="#0000ff" size="2"><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b> </font>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
        OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
        distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
        exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to 
        the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
        laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
        unavailability or interruption of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
        ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
        WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
        LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
        NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
        DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
        HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>7. GENERAL</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
        the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
        action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with 
        respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or 
        counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that 
        Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as 
        of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient 
        institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a 
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program 
        itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or 
        hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's 
        rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such 
        litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
        fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
        Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
        time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
        rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
        granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and 
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
        but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and 
        may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward 
        reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of 
        this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement 
        Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial 
        Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the 
        Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of 
        the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The 
        Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to 
        the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, 
        after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may 
        elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under 
        the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) 
        above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual 
        property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, 
        by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not 
        expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and 
        the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No 
        party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement 
        more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives 
        its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
=======================================================

JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.

In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
under the Jython specific license below.

From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed
Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are
covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.

The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation
license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.

The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
Software License.

The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software
License.  See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.

      <pre>A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is &quot;not incompatible&quot; with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE 
        PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF 
        THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. DEFINITIONS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contribution&quot; means:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
        documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        i) changes to the Program, and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        ii) additions to the Program;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and 
        are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 
        'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
        Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are 
        separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the 
        Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative 
        works of the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor 
        which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution 
        alone or when combined with the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this 
        Agreement, including all Contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b>
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
        license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
        publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
        object code form.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
        license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
        import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
        any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
        apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
        the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition 
        of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the 
        Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other 
        combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
        licensed hereunder.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
        provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
        patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
        Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
        any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
        or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
        granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility 
        to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
        Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
        to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
        license set forth in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
        under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) its license agreement:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
        Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
        within the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
        Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
        Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
        responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
        like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
        of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
        commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
        create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
        Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
        such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend 
        and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) 
        against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising 
        from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
        against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
        or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
        distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
        obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
        In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
        notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
        allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
        claim at its own expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
        product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
        Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
        claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
        claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
        alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
        defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
        performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
        Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
        must pay those damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5. NO WARRANTY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
        OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
        distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
        exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to 
        the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
        laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
        unavailability or interruption of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
        ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
        WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
        LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
        NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
        DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
        HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>7. GENERAL</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
        the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
        action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
        the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
        software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
        Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of 
        the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
        fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
        Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
        time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
        rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
        granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and 
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
        but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and 
        may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward 
        reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of 
        this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement 
        Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation 
        is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign 
        the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable 
        separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
        distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) 
        may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
        under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the

      <h2>
        <a name="SEC2" href="#TOC2">Preamble</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom 
        to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses 
        are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
        software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some 
        specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the 
        Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You 
        can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether 
        this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better 
        strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations 
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, 
        not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
        for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get 
        it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of 
        it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
        you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis 
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave 
        you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source 
        code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide 
        complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them 
        with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
        it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
        library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there 
        is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified 
        by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what 
        they have is not the original version, so that the original author's 
        reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced 
        by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of 
        any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
        effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
        restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that 
        any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be 
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the 
        ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and 
        is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use 
        this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
        libraries into non-free programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a 
        shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a 
        combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary 
        General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the 
        entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General 
        Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with 
        the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it 
        does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General 
        Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less 
        of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages 
        are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
        libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
        special circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to 
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it 
        becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must 
        be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free 
        library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this 
        case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
        software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
        programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of 
        free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in 
        non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
        operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating 
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 
        users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is 
        linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
        that program using a modified version of the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
        modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 
        &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The 
        former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must 
        be combined with the library in order to run.

      <h2>
        <a name="SEC3" href="#TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, 
        DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software 
        library or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
        copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
        distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License 
        (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data 
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
        (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work 
        which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the 
        Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under 
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a 
        portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
        straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is 
        included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
        making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means 
        all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated 
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
        compilation and installation of the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 
        running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from 
        such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based 
        on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for 
        writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and 
        what the program that uses the Library does.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
        Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
        provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
        an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep 
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence 
        of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the 
        Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
        you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library 
        or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and 
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
        Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software 
          library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry 
          prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of 
          any change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be 
          licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
          License.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to 
          a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application 
          program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed 
          when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such 
          function or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
          whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          <p>
            (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has 
            a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the 
            application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
            application-supplied function or table used by this function must 
            be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square 
            root function must still compute square roots.)
          </p>
          <p>
            These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
            identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
            Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
            works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
            apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
            works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
            whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
            the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions 
            for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each 
            and every part regardless of who wrote it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or 
            contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
            intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of 
            derivative or collective works based on the Library.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
            Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on 
            a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the 
            other work under the scope of this License.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
        General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
        Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
        License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public 
        License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version 
        than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has 
        appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do 
        not make any other change in these notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
        copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
        subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
        Library into a program that is not a library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a 
        portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
        executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided 
        that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from 
        a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
        code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the 
        source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
        source along with the object code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any 
        portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by 
        being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
        Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it 
        contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the 
        library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 
        6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file 
        that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
        derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
        Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be 
        linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The 
        threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
        layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions 
        (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is 
        unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. 
        (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
        will still fall under Section 6.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
        distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
        Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, 
        whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may 
        also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
        to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
        that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit 
        modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 
        engineering for debugging such modifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
        this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work 
        during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
        copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
        directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one 
        of these things:
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete 
          corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including 
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed 
          under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable 
          linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work 
          that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that 
          the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
          modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
          understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions 
          files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
          application to use the modified definitions.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for 
          linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses 
          at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
          executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
          the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
          version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
          made with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid 
          for at least three years, to give the same user the materials 
          specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the 
          cost of performing this distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by offering 
          access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
          copy the above specified materials from the same place.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a copy 
          of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for 
        reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, 
        the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is 
        normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
        which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
        the executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
        accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
        use both them and the Library together in an executable that you 
        distribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work 
        based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
        other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute 
        such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of 
        the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
        otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of 
          the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other 
          library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the 
          Sections above.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library 
          of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
          explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the 
          same work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
        or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
        or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate 
        your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
        copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
        licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since 
        you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to 
        modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These 
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based 
        on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do 
        so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
        modifying the Library or works based on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any 
        work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
        license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or 
        modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
        impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
        rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
        compliance by third parties with this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
        allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
        to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. 
        If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
        obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, 
        then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For 
        example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
        redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly 
        or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it 
        and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the 
        Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
        any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
        apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
        integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made 
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
        impose that choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
        restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
        this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in 
        or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
        and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
        time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
        version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 
        &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and 
        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
        the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a 
        license version number, you may choose any version ever published by 
        the Free Software Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library 
        into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
        incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.

      </h2>
      <p>
        If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 
        possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that 
        everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting 
        redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms 
        of the ordinary General Public License).
      </p>
      <p>
        To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It 
        is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
        effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should 
        have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full 
        notice is found.

      The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source Software-only

      <p>
        Exception Intent
      </p>
      <p>
        We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'') 
        applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client 
        libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS 
        licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public 
        License (the ``GPL'').

      <h3>
        Legal Terms and Conditions
      </h3>
      As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the 
      GPL:

      <ol>
        <li>
          You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely 
          from the Program and one or more works (each, a &quot;FLOSS Work&quot;) 
          licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 
          1, as long as:<br>a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the 
          Program and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of 
          the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program, and 
          which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in 
          themselves,<br>b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work 
          which are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be 
          considered independent and separate works in themselves,<br>i. are 
          distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and<br>ii. 
          the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied 
          by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those 
          sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the 
          corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and<br>c. 
          any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative 
          Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance 
          with the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate 
          works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program, 
          a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.<br>If the above conditions are 
          not met, then the Program may only be copied, modified, distributed 
          or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL or another valid 
          licensing option from MySQL AB.

          contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the Program may be 
          distributed under the terms of this FLOSS Exception. If you create 
          or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of both the Program 
          and any other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception 
          is not available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS 
          Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all 
          respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may choose to 
          redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of 
          the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the 
          Program, provided that the copy has never been modified by you or 
          any third party.

          3.1. Availability of Source Code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available 
          in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form 
          and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms 
          of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every 
          copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute 
          or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such 
          Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such 
          Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or 
          through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

          3.2. Modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are 
          governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You 
          believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You 
          have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

        <p>
          3.3. Required Notices.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that 
          identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not 
          remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained 
          within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any 
          descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the 
          Initial Developer.

        <p>
          3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in 
          Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of 
          this License or the recipients&#65533; rights hereunder. You may choose to 
          offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
          liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. 
          However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of 
          the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it 
          absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or 
          liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree 
          to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
          liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a 
          result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under 
          the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your 
          choice, which may contain terms different from this License, 
          provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License 
          and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 
          limit or alter the recipient&#65533;s rights in the Source Code form from 
          the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered 
          Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make 
          it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License 
          are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or 
          Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and 
          every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
          Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You 
          offer.

        <p>
          3.6. Larger Works.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with 
          other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute 
          the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make 
          sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered 
          Software.

          Oracle Corp. is the initial license steward and may publish revised 
          and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version 
          will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in

          You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the 
          Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the 
          License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If 
          the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software 
          prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available 
          under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and 
          make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version 
          of the License under which You originally received the Covered 
          Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or

          When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new 
          license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a 
          modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and 
          remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to 
          note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise 
          make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this 
          License.

        The Covered Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined 
        in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer 
        software&quot; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) 
        and &quot;commercial computer software documentation&quot; as such terms are 
        used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.

        9. MISCELLANEOUS.
      </p>
      <p>
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject 
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
        necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by 
        the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the 
        Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, 
        provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law 
        provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject 
        to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and 
        venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, 
        with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without 
        limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. 
        The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
        International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or 
        regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be 
        construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You 
        agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United 
        States export administration regulations (and the export control laws 
        and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or 
        otherwise make available any Covered Software.

        10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is 
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, 
        out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
        work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such 
        responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or 
        shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

        DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
      </p>
      <p>
        The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the 
        State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any 
        litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the 
        jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of 
        California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue 
        lying in Santa Clara County, California.

      <br>
      

      <p>
        Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple 
        Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
        license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preamble
      </p>
      <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom 
        to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
        intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
        software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This 
        General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
        Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
        using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
        the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to 
        your programs, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
        this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
        in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
        anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
        These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if 
        you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
        you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
        rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
        (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
        distribute and/or modify the software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
        that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
        software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, 
        we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the 
        original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect 
        on the original authors' reputations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
        patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
        program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
        program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
        patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
        modification follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><b>0.</b></span> This License applies to any program or other 
        work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it 
        may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The 
        &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work 
        based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work 
        under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or 
        a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
        translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is 
        included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee 
        is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 
        running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
        is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
        (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that 
        is true depends on what the Program does.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><b>1.</b></span> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of 
        the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided 
        that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
        all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
        warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this 
        License along with the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
        you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><b>2.</b></span> You may modify your copy or copies of the 
        Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the 
        Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the 
        terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
        conditions:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
          whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part 
          thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties 
          under the terms of this License.
        </p>
        <p>
          c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
          announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice 
          that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a 
          warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
          conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
          (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
          normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program 
          is not required to print an announcement.)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
        sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
        on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote 
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
        your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
        exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
        collective works based on the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
        with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
        a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
        the scope of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><b>3.</b></span> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a 
        work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
        under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do 
        one of the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
          and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; 
          or,
        </p>
        <p>
          b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost 
          of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
          customarily used for software interchange; or,
        </p>
        <p>
          c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
          distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed 
          only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the 
          program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in 
          accord with Subsection b above.)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
        making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source 
        code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
        associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
        control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a 
        special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
        anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
        form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
        operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
        itself accompanies the executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
        distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><b>4.</b></span> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or 
        distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this 
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or 
        distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your 
        rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, 
        or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><b>5.</b></span> You are not required to accept this License, 
        since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you 
        permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative 
        works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
        License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any 
        work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this 
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
        distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><b>6.</b></span> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any 
        work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a 
        license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the 
        Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any 
        further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
        herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
        parties to this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><b>7.</b></span> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
        allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
        to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. 
        If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
        obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, 
        then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For 
        example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
        redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly 
        or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it 
        and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the 
        Program.

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
        integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made 
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
        impose that choice.

      <p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.

      <p>
        <span><b>8.</b></span> If the distribution and/or use of the Program 
        is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under 
        this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in 
        or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

      </p>
      <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and

        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
        the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a

        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      </p>
      <p>
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
        possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
        free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these 
        terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to 
        attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
        the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

          it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

          (at your option) any later version.
        </p>

          WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

          General Public License for more details.

        <p>
          You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
          along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

      <p>
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper 
        mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
        when it starts in an interactive mode:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>Gnomovision 
          comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This 
          is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under 
          certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
        appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the 
        commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show 
        c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your 
        program.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or 
        your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, 
        if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

        <p>
          As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to version 3 of the

        <p>
          &#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this License, 
          other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        </p>
        <p>
          An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
          by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
          Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a 
          mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an 
          Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library 
          with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked 
          Version&#8221;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
          Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source 
          code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in 
          isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked 
          Version.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
          object code and/or source code for the Application, including any 
          data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work 
          from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the 
          Combined Work.

</a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        </h4>
        <p>
          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License 
          without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

</a>2. Conveying Modified Versions.
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
          facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an 
          Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed 
          when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the 
          modified version:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort 
            to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the 
            function or data, the facility still operates, and performs 
            whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
          </li>
          <li>
            b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of 
            this License applicable to that copy.

</a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from 
          a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such 
          object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the 
          incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data 
          structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions 
          and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the 
          following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that 
            the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
            covered by this License.
          </li>
          <li>
            b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
            license document.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>

</a>4. Combined Works.
        </h4>
        <p>
          You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, 
          taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the 
          portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse 
          engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of 
          the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that 
            the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
            covered by this License.
          </li>
          <li>
            b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
            license document.
          </li>
          <li>
            c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during 
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among 
            these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the 
            copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          </li>
          <li>
            d) Do one of the following:

            <ul>
              <li>
                0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of 
                this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form 
                suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to 
                recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of 
                the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the 
                manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
                Corresponding Source.
              </li>
              <li>
                1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
                the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run 
                time a copy of the Library already present on the user's 
                computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified 
                version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
                Linked Version.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would 
            otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 
            of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is 
            necessary to install and execute a modified version of the 
            Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application 
            with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 
            4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal 
            Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you 
            use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in 
            the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
            Corresponding Source.)

        <h4>
          <a name="section5">
</a>5. Combined Libraries.
        </h4>
        <p>
          You may place library facilities that are a work based on the 
          Library side by side in a single library together with other library 
          facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this 
          License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work 
            based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
            facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
          </li>
          <li>
            b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it 
            is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
            accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

</a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
          versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
          differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
          Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version 
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; 
          applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and 
          conditions either of that published version or of any later version 
          published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you 
          received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License ever published by the Free Software 
          Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide 
          whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
          shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any 
          version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version 
          for the Library.

        The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software, examples 
        of which include, but are not limited to, p2 and the Eclipse Update 
        Manager (&quot;Provisioning Technology&quot;) for the purpose of allowing users 
        to install software, documentation, information and/or other materials 
        (collectively &quot;Installable Software&quot;). This capability is provided 
        with the intent of allowing such users to install, extend and update 
        Eclipse-based products. Information about packaging Installable 
        Software is available at <a href="http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html">http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html</a>

        Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the 
        applicable license agreements relating to the Installable Software to 
        be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the Provisioning 
        Technology in accordance with the Specification. By using Provisioning 
        Technology in such a manner and making it available in accordance with 
        the Specification, you further acknowledge your agreement to, and the 
        acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A series of actions may occur (&quot;Provisioning Process&quot;) in which a

        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE 
        PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF 
        THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

      <p>
        1. DEFINITIONS
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contribution&quot; means:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
        documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      </p>
      <p>
        i) changes to the Program, and
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to 
        the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular 
        Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was 
        added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on 
        such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
        the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in 
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and 
        (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &quot;Contributor&quot; means any 
        person or entity that distributes the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor 
        which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution 
        alone or when combined with the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this 
        Agreement, including all Contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
        license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
        publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
        object code form.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
        license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
        import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
        any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
        apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
        the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition 
        of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the 
        Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other 
        combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
        licensed hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
        provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
        patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
        Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
        any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
        or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
        granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility 
        to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
        Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
        to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
        license set forth in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. REQUIREMENTS
      </p>
      <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
        under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) its license agreement:
      </p>
      <p>
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </p>
      <p>
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      </p>
      <p>
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
        Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
        within the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
        Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
        Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
        responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
        like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
        of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
        commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
        create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
        Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
        such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend 
        and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) 
        against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising 
        from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
        against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
        or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
        distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
        obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
        In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
        notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
        allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
        claim at its own expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
        product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
        Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
        claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
        claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
        alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
        defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
        performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
        Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
        must pay those damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. NO WARRANTY
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
        OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
        distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
        exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to 
        the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
        laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
        unavailability or interruption of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
        ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
        WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
        LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
        NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
        DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
        HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. GENERAL
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
        the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
        action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
        the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
        software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
        Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of 
        the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
        fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
        Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
        time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
        rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
        granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and 
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
        but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and 
        may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward 
        reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of 
        this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement 
        Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation 
        is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign 
        the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable 
        separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
        distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) 
        may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
        under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
        Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
        Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as 
        expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives 
        no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor 
        under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or 
        otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this 
        Agreement are reserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and 
        the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No 
        party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement 
        more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives 
        its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

      <p>
        As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to version 3 of the 
        GNU General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other 
        than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
      </p>
      <p>
        An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode 
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an 
        Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library 
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked 
        Version&#8221;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code 
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are 
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data 
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the 
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

      <p>
        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application 
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the 
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified 
        version:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to 
          ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the 
          function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
          part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        </li>
        <li>
          b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of

</a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a 
        header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object 
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated 
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure

        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for 
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>

          c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during 
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these

        This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the

</a>0. Additional Definitions.
      </h4>
      <p>
        As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to version 3 of the 
        GNU General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other 
        than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
      </p>
      <p>
        An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode 
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an 
        Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library 
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked 
        Version&#8221;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code 
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are 
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data 
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the 
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="section1">
</a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

      <p>
        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License 
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

      </h4>
      <p>
        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application 
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the 
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified 
        version:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to 
          ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the 
          function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
          part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        </li>
        <li>
          b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of 
          this License applicable to that copy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        <a name="section3">
</a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a 
        header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object 
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated 
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure 
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates 
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the 
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered 
          by this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
          license document.

      </ul>
      <h4>
        <a name="section4">
</a>4. Combined Works.
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken 
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of 
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for 
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that 
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
          covered by this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
          license document.
        </li>
        <li>
          c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during 
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these 
          notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of 
          the GNU GPL and this license document.
        </li>
        <li>
          d) Do one of the following:

          <ul>
            <li>
              0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of

              specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
              Corresponding Source.
            </li>
            <li>
              1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
              Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a

      The Metro II Ptolemy domain code that uses Google ProtoBuf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Google site for <a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/#in_browser">Protocol

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      &quot;Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On December 10, 2012, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/#in_browser">Protocol 
      Buffers</a> stated that ProtoBuf was under the &quot;New BSD License&quot; and 
      linked to <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause/#in_browser" target="_top">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause</a>, 
      which stated:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <h2>
        The BSD 3-Clause License
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following is a BSD 3-Clause (&quot;BSD New&quot; or &quot;BSD Simplified&quot;) 
        license template. To generate your own license, change the values of 
        OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values as given here, 
        and substitute your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: You may omit clause 3 and still be OSD-conformant. Despite its 
        colloquial name &quot;BSD New&quot;, this is not the newest version of the BSD 
        license; it was followed by the even newer BSD-2-Clause version, 
        sometimes known as the &quot;Simplified BSD License&quot;. On January 9th, 2008 
        the OSI Board approved BSD-2-Clause, which is used by FreeBSD and 
        others. It omits the final &quot;no-endorsement&quot; clause and is thus roughly 
        equivalent to the MIT License.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historical Background: The original license used on BSD Unix had four 
        clauses. The advertising clause (the third of four clauses) required 
        you to acknowledge use of U.C. Berkeley code in your advertising of 
        any product using that code. It was officially rescinded by the 
        Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of the University of 
        California on July 22nd, 1999. He states that clause 3 is &quot;hereby 
        deleted in its entirety.&quot; The four clause license has not been 
        approved by OSI. The license below does not contain the advertising 
        clause.
      </p>
      <p>
        This prelude is not part of the license.
      </p>

        &lt;OWNER&gt; = Regents of the University of California<br>&lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; 
        = University of California, Berkeley<br>&lt;YEAR&gt; = 1998
      </p>
      <p>
        In the original BSD license, both occurrences of the phrase &quot;COPYRIGHT 
        HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS&quot; in the disclaimer read &quot;REGENTS AND 
        CONTRIBUTORS&quot;.

    <p>
      We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public 
      domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source 
      code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including 
      the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.
    </p>
    <p>
      We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask 
      that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By &quot;credit&quot;, we mean 
      that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your 
      programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you 
      acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, 
      etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, 
      please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask 
      that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these 
      guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and 
      expect to make other tools available as they are completed.

</a>      </h1>
      <a name="ptjacl">Jacl is a 100% Java implementation of Tcl that we use 
      for testing Ptolemy II. Each Java directory contains a <code>test</code> 
      subdirectory that contains Tcl files that use Jacl to test the Ptolemy 
      II Java code. </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacl is <b>only</b> necessary if you are planning on running the Ptolemy 
      II test suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ship a customized version of Jacl called Ptjacl. The primary 
      difference between Ptjacl and Jacl1.1 is that Ptjacl is shipped as one 
      jar file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ptjacl jar file at <code>$PTII/lib/ptjacl.jar</code> is shipped with 
      Ptolemy II.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

        Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)

  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

        NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line="#DEFAULT" to="#DEFAULT" give="#DEFAULT" the="#DEFAULT" library="#DEFAULT" s="#DEFAULT" name="#DEFAULT" and="#DEFAULT" a="#DEFAULT" brief="#DEFAULT" idea="#DEFAULT" of="#DEFAULT" what="#DEFAULT" it="#DEFAULT" does.="#DEFAULT">

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

        <h2>
          <a name="SEC2" href="#TOC1">Preamble</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
          freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
          Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
          free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
        </p>
        <p>
          This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some 
          specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any 
          other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for 
          your libraries, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
          price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
          you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and 
          charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code 
          or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or 
          use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do 
          these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
          anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the 
          rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
          you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis 
          or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we 
          gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
          source code. If you link a program with the library, you must 
          provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can 
          relink them with the library, after making changes to the library 
          and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know 
          their rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright 
          the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal 
          permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain 
          that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
          library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, 
          we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the 
          original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not 
          reflect on the original authors' reputations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
          patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing 
          free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in 
          effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To 
          prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed 
          for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the 
          ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility 
          programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, 
          applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite 
          different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and 
          don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary 
          license.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is 
          that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or 
          adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a 
          library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using 
          the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or 
          application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the 
          linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original 
          library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General 
          Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software 
          sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We 
          concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the 
          users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the 
          libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is 
          intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free 
          libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs 
          to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have 
          not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but 
          we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of 
          the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development 
          of free libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
          modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 
          &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The 
          former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only 
          works together with the library.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary 
          General Public License rather than by this special one.

        <h2>
          <a name="SEC3" href="#TOC1">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, 
          DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software 
          library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or 
          other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms 
          of this Library General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). 
          Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data 
          prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
          (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work 
          which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the 
          Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under 
          copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a 
          portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
          translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, 
          translation is included without limitation in the term 
          &quot;modification&quot;.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
          making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code 
          means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
          associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
          control compilation and installation of the library.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
          covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 
          running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output 
          from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a 
          work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in 
          a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the 
          Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of 
          the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
          provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
          copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
          keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the 
          absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along 
          with the Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, 
          and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for 
          a fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the 
          Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the 
          Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under 
          the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
          these conditions:<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
          <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
          
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software 
            library.

            <p>
              
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry 
            prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date 
            of any change.

            <p>
              
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be 
            licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
            License.

            <p>
              
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers 
            to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application 
            program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed 
            when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith 
            effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
            such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
            whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a 
            function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that 
            is entirely well-defined independent of the application. 
            Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied 
            function or table used by this function must be optional: if the 
            application does not supply it, the square root function must 
            still compute square roots.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
          identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, 
          and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
          themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
          sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
          distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work 
          based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the 
          terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend 
          to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
          who wrote it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or 
          contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
          intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of 
          derivative or collective works based on the Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
          Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a 
          volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
          work under the scope of this License.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary 
          GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy 
          of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
          refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
          General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a 
          newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public 
          License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if 
          you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for 
          that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
          subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
          Library into a program that is not a library.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a 
          portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
          executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided 
          that you accompany it with the complete corresponding 
          machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the 
          terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
          software interchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy 
          from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
          source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to 
          distribute the source code, even though third parties are not 
          compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any 
          portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by 
          being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the 
          Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
          Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
          creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because 
          it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses 
          the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
          Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file 
          that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
          derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
          Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be 
          linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The 
          threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
          structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
          functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
          file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
          derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
          portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
          distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 
          6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, 
          whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may 
          also compile or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
          to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
          that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit 
          modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 
          engineering for debugging such modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered 
          by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work 
          during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
          copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
          directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do 
          one of these things:<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
          <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
          
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete 
            corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library 
            including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be 
            distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
            executable linked with the Library, with the complete 
            machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code 
            and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and 
            then relink to produce a modified executable containing the 
            modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the 
            contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily 
            be able to recompile the application to use the modified 
            definitions.)

            <p>
              
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid 
            for at least three years, to give the same user the materials 
            specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the 
            cost of performing this distribution.

            <p>
              
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by 
            offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent 
            access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.

            <p>
              
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>d)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a 
            copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a 
            copy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the 
          Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for 
          reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, 
          the source code distributed need not include anything that is 
          normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the 
          major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating 
          system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
          accompanies the executable.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
          restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
          accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you 
          cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
          you distribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work 
          based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
          other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute 
          such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of 
          the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
          otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
          <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
          
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of 
            the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other 
            library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of 
            the Sections above.

            <p>
              
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined 
            library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the 
            Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined 
            form of the same work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
          or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
          License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
          with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
          terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
          received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
          have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
          full compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, 
          since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you 
          permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative 
          works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
          License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
          work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
          License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
          distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any 
          work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
          license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or 
          modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may 
          not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
          the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
          compliance by third parties to this License.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
          allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not 
          limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by 
          court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions 
          of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
          License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
          your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
          obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
          Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit 
          royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
          copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
          could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely 
          from distribution of the Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
          under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
          intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply 
          in other circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
          patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
          such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
          integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
          implemented by public license practices. Many people have made 
          generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
          through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
          system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is 
          willing to distribute software through any other system and a 
          licensee cannot impose that choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed 
          to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library 
          is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by 
          copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the 
          Library under this License may add an explicit geographical 
          distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
          distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus 
          excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as 
          if written in the body of this License.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish 
          revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License 
          from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to 
          the present version, but may differ in detail to address new 
          problems or concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
          Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
          it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the 
          terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version 
          published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not 
          specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever 
          published by the Free Software Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library 
          into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
          incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. 
          For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
          write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
          for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
          the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
          promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>15.</strong> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
          APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE 
          COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; 
          WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
          INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
          MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE 
          RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. 
          SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
          NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>16.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW 
          OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER 
          PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
          ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
          INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
          INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF 
          DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
          THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
          SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
          THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

          If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 
          possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software 
          that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
          permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, 
          under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
        </p>
        <p>
          To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. 
          It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
          effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should 
          have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full 
          notice is found.

    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
