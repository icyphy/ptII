Ptolemy II is a software framework developed as part of the
Ptolemy Project.
It is a Java-based component assembly framework with a graphical
user interface called Vergil.  Vergil itself is a component assembly
defined in Ptolemy II.
<p>
The Ptolemy project studies modeling, simulation, and design of
concurrent, real-time, embedded systems. The focus is on assembly of
concurrent components. The key underlying principle in the project is
the use of well-defined <i>models of computation</i> that govern the
interactions between components. A major problem area being addressed is
the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation.

The work is conducted in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Sciences of the University of California at Berkeley.  The
project is directed by Prof. Edward A. Lee.  The project is named
after Claudius Ptolemaeus the second century Greek astronomer,
mathematician, and geographer.
