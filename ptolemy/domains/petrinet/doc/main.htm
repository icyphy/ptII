<h1>Petrinet</h1>
<P>
 This domain implements the basic Petri Net model where Places and Transitions
 form a bipartite graph and enabled Transitions can fire randomly. It also
 allows Transitions to be replaced by any other Actors in Ptolemy. It
 implements two forms of Hierarchical and compositional Petri nets. The first
 form of hierarchical and compositional Petri net semantics comes from the
 fact that a Transition can contain a sub-Petri-net which is invisible to the
 director of the container of the Transition. The second form of hierarchical
 and compositional Petri net semantics comes from a new Actor called
 PetriNetActor which is a collection of Places and Transitions, and those
 Places and Transitions are visible to the director of the container of the
 PetriNetActor. The users can choose which form of models to use, and/or mix
 them together.
 <p>
 The basic Petri net is a directed, weighted, bipartite graph consisting of
 two kinds of nodes, called <i>Places</i> and <i>Transitions</i>, where arcs
 are either from a Place to a Transition or from a Transition to a Place. In
 graphical representation, Places are drawn as circles, Transitions as bars or
 boxes. Arcs are labeled with their <i>weights</i> (positive integers).
 Labels of unity weight are usually omitted. Multiple arcs can exist between a
 Place and a Transition. A <i>marking</i> assigns to each Place <i>p</i> an
 nonnegative integer <i>k</i>, we say that <i>p</i> is <i>marked with k
 tokens</i>.
