<dt> How do I start Vergil by hand?
<dd> See
<a href="ptIIfaq.htm#invoking Ptolemy II?">How do I invoke Ptolemy II?</a>

<dt> The user interface appears to be frozen, but windows are redrawn.

<dd> A modal dialog may be open.  Unfortunately, these dialogs do not
appear in the task bar on windows systems, so the only way to find
them is to put windows in the background until they appear.  You can
do this by repeatedly hitting Alt-Escape.</li>

<dt> My model hangs, failing to make progress.

<dd> In the DE domain, if an actor has input tokens that it fails to
consume when it is fired, then it the director will continue to fire
it repeatedly until those tokens are consumed.  Actors in the DE
domain must consume pending input tokens.

<dt> Ptolemy seems to consume more and more memory after opening and closing several demos.

<dd> 
The drag and drop mechanism has contained many memory leaks in older versions
of Sun's JDK.   The leak occurs because there are references internal to the
platform drag and drop system that do not allow windows using drag and drop 
to be properly garbage collected after they are no longer visible. 
If you run into problems, we strongly suggest upgrading to the
newest version of Java.  We have seen memory leaks of this sort in versions
of Java prior to 1.3.1 beta.
