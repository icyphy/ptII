<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
The <a href="troubleshooting.htm">Ptolemy II Troubleshooting Guide</a>
has hints about solving problems.

<h3>Ptolemy Mailing Lists</h3>

The Ptolemy mailing lists are run by the Majordomo mailing list
server.  This server can automatically subscribe you to mailing
lists and it can send you monthly archive files for each of the
lists.  To find out more about our Majordomo sever, send an email
letter to: majordomo@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu with the word "help"
in the body of the letter.

<h4>Ptolemy Interest Mailing list</h4>

This moderated mailing list is for Ptolemy announcements only. Thus,
you cannot post to this group.  The amount of mail here is kept very
light (a few messages a year).

To subscribe to the ptolemy-interest mailing list, send mail to:
<a href="mailto:ptolemy-interest-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>ptolemy-interest-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></a>
with the word <CODE>subscribe</CODE>
in the body (not the subject) of the letter.

 <p>All mail to ptolemy-interest also goes to ptolemy-hackers, so if you
subscribe to ptolemy-hackers, there is no need to subscribe to
ptolemy-interest too.

<h4>Ptolemy Hackers Mailing list</h4>

This is a discussion list for Ptolemy questions, bug reports, and to
share Ptolemy additions and applications.  Since this is a discussion
group, mail volume can sometimes be heavy.  All mail sent to Ptolemy-
hackers is automatically cross posted to the
<a href="news:comp.soft-sys.ptolemy"><CODE>comp.soft-sys.ptolemy</CODE></a>
newsgroup.

To subscribe to the ptolemy-hackers mailing list, send mail to:
<a href="mailto:ptolemy-hackers-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>ptolemy-hackers-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></a>
with the word <CODE>subscribe</CODE> in the body of the letter.
To stop receiving email from the mailing list,  put
the word <CODE>unsubscribe</CODE> the body of your message.

<h4>The ptII account</h4>

Ptolemy is distributed without support or warranty.  However, if you
really need to contact a human being with a Ptolemy II question, you can
send email to:
ptII at eecs berkeley edu



<h4>comp.soft-sys.ptolemy</h4>

Just like the ptolemy-hackers mailing list, the
<a href="news:comp.soft-sys.ptolemy"><CODE>comp.soft-sys.ptolemy</CODE></a>
newsgroup is a forum of the discussion of Ptolemy questions, bug
reports, additions, and applications.  Note that all mail sent to the
ptolemy-hackers mailing list is automatically posted to the
comp.soft-sys.ptolemy newsgroup as well.

 <p>The name is chosen to correspond to similar newsgroups for the Khoros
and Matlab systems, which are also under comp.soft-sys.

<h4>Searching the Archives</h4>
The Ptolemy Web Site search page has links to search engines for
the various forms of the mailing list and for the Ptolemy website.
