For the purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

      Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

      Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      ** NEWS **
      ----------

      Version 1.2a:

      - AElfred has a new maintainer.  Side-effects of this will include
      a gradual change in the indenting style of the source code, a
      mixture of Unix and MSDOS-style text files, and other things that
      people who actually use the source code will find annoying.
      
      The transition will be complete at the next numbered release.

      - Source code directory tree has changed to reflect JDK 1.2 requirements.

      - Other small tweaks to allow compilation under JDK 1.2.

      - No longer crashes when reading longish files from a Reader.

      - No longer hangs when syntax errors appear after the document element.

      - aelfred.jar is no longer out of date :-).

      - XmlApp, the base class for the included demos, no longer extends Applet.
      The new class, XmlApplet, now works both as an applet and application
      like XmlApp used to.  JDK 1.2 beta 3 had problems with this behaviour --
      if an Applet was constructed (but not used) in an app, its finalization
      would hang the JVM.  This change will persist even after the JDK bug is
      fixed.
      
      The demos, therefore, no longer work as applets.

      - Performance should be somewhat improved.

      Version 1.2:

      - AElfred can parse from an InputStream, Reader, or a system ID
      - resolveEntity() can return an InputStream or Reader as well as a
      system ID
      - new SAX driver for SAX 1.0gamma (http://www.megginson.com/SAX/)


      DESIGN PRINCIPLES
      -----------------

      In most Java applets and applications, XML should not be the central
      feature; instead, XML is the means to another end, such as loading
      configuration information, reading meta-data, or parsing transactions.

      When an XML parser is only a single component of a much larger
      program, it cannot be large, slow, or resource-intensive.  With Java
      applets, in particular, few programmers would be willing to require
      users to download an additional 50K to 100K in class files just for
      the sake of adding XML capability.

      AElfred is a new Java-based XML parser from Microstar Software
      Ltd. (http://www.microstar.com/), an established provider of XML and
      SGML solutions.  AElfred is distributed for free (with full source) for
      both commercial and non-commercial use, and is designed for easy and
      efficient use over the Internet, based on the following principles:

      1. AElfred must be as small as possible, so that it doesn't add too
      much to your applet's download time.

      STATUS: AElfred is currently about 26K in total.  The compressed
      JAR file, including the optional classes, is only 15K.

      2. AElfred must use as few class files as possible, to minimize the number
      of HTTP connections necessary.

      STATUS: AElfred consists of only two core class files, the main
      parser class (XmlParser.class) and a small interface for your own
      program to implement (XmlHandler.class).  All other classes in
      the distribution are either optional or for demonstration only.

      3. AElfred must be compatible with most or all Java implementations
      and platforms.

      STATUS: AElfred uses mainly JDK 1.0.2 features (you may parse from
      a JDK 1.1 Reader if you wish), and we have tested it successfully
      with the following Java implementations: JDK 1.1.1 (Linux), jview
      (Windows NT), Netscape 4 (Linux and Windows NT), Internet Explorer
      3 (Windows NT), and Internet Explorer 4 (Windows NT).

      4. AElfred must use as little memory as possible, so that it does not take
      away resources from the rest of your program.

      STATUS: On a P75 Linux system, using JDK 1.1.1, running AElfred
      (with a 4MB XML document) takes only 2MB more memory than running
      a simple &quot;Hello world&quot; Java application.  Because AElfred does not
      build an in-memory parse tree, you can run it on very large input
      files using little or no extra memory.

      5. AElfred must run as fast as possible, so that it does not slow down
      the rest of your program.

      STATUS: On a P75 Linux system, using JDK 1.1.1 (without a JIT
      compiler), AElfred parses test files at about 70K/second.  On a
      P166 NT workstation, using jview, AElfred parses test files at
      about about 1MB/second.

      6. AElfred must produce correct output for well-formed and valid
      documents, but need not reject every document that is not valid or
      not well-formed.

      STATUS: AElfred is DTD-aware, and handles all current XML features,
      including CDATA and INCLUDE/IGNORE marked sections, internal and
      external entities, proper whitespace treatment in element content,
      and default attribute values.  It will sometimes accept input that
      is technically incorrect, however, without reporting an error (see
      below), since full error reporting would make the parser larger.

      7. AElfred must provide full internationalisation from the first release.

      STATUS: AElfred supports Unicode to the fullest extent possible in
      Java.  It correctly handles XML documents encoded using UTF-8,
      UTF-16, ISO-10646-UCS-2, ISO-10646-UCS-4 (as far as surrogates
      allow), and ISO-8859-1 (ISO Latin 1/Windows).  With these
      character sets, AElfred can handle all of the world's major (and
      most of its minor) languages.  To support other character
      encodings, you can supply your own Reader.

      As you can see from this list, AElfred is designed for production use,
      not for validation: it will behave correctly with correct files, but
      it will not necessarily let you know when there are errors.  If you
      want to verify on your system that your XML document is valid or
      well-formed before you publish it to the Internet, then you should use
      a validating XML parser.


      SAX
      ---

      AElfred now has a SAX 1.0 (gamma) driver built-in to the main
      distribution, so there is no need to use an external driver.  The
      class name of the driver is

      com.microstar.xml.driver.SAXDriver

      [Ptolemy Note:  We moved SAXDriver.java into the driver subdirectory
      because 'make fast' runs javac *.java, which was causing problems
      because SAXDriver uses SAX, which we do not ship]

      STARTUP
      -------

      To test the parser, you can try one of the demonstration applications
      EventDemo, TimerDemo, DtdDemo, or StreamDemo (see descriptions below).
      To start an application, make certain that AElfred's classes are
      somewhere on your CLASSPATH, then use a command line like the
      following:

      java EventDemo <uri>

        Where <uri> can be relative (i.e. a file in the current directory) or
          absolute (i.e. an XML document anywhere on the Internet).  Note that
          StreamDemo takes a file name rather than a URI.

          XML parsers like AElfred read one or more source files (called
          &quot;entities&quot;), and merge them into a single stream of logical events,
          such as character data, processing instructions, or the start or end
          of elements.  The EventDemo demonstration application gives you an
          idea of what information appears in the stream.


          PROGRAMMER'S USAGE
          ------------------

          To use AElfred in your own Java applets or applications, you need to
          supply a class that implements the com.microstar.xml.XmlHandler
          interface (say, &quot;MyHandler&quot;), create a new com.microstar.xml.XmlParser
          object (supplying the URI of the XML document), then explicitly start
          a parse:

          import com.microstar.xml.XmlParser;

          [...]

          String uri = &quot;http://www.host.com/sample.xml&quot;;
          MyHandler handler = new MyHandler();
          XmlParser parser = new XmlParser();

          parser.setHandler(handler);
          parser.parse(uri, null, null);

          During the parse, AElfred will call methods in your handler to report
          events; for example, whenever a new element begins, it will call your
          method

          void startElement(String name)

          There are thirteen callback methods altogether in the XmlHandler
          interface; for details, see HTML/com.microstar.xml.XmlHandler.html:

          public void startDocument ();
          public void endDocument ();
          public String resolveEntity (String ename, String publicId, String systemId);
          public String startExternalEntity (String systemId);
          public String endExternalEntity (String systemId);
          public void doctypeDecl (String dname, String publicId, String systemId);
          public void attribute (String name, String value, boolean isSpecified);
          public void startElement (String elname);
          public void endElement (String elname);
          public void charData (char ch[], int start, int length);
          public void ignorableWhitespace (char ch[], int start, int length);
          public void processingInstruction (String target, String data);
          public void error (String message, String url, int line, int column);

          If you want to avoid implementing all of these, you can derive your
          handler from com.microstar.xml.HandlerBase (see below), then fill in
          only the ones you need.


          REQUIRED CLASSES
          ----------------

          If you want to use the XML parser with a Java applet, these are the
          only two classes that you must install (in addition to your own class
          that implements the XmlHandler interface):

          com/microstar/xml/XmlParser.class              
          The actual XML parser.

          com/microstar/xml/XmlHandler.class      
          The callback interface for the XML parser.


          OPTIONAL CLASSES
          ----------------

          There are three optional classes that you may choose to install on a
          web site (all are very small):

          com/microstar/xml/XmlException.class
          A convenience class for reporting XML
          parsing errors.

          com/microstar/xml/HandlerBase.class
          (Requires XmlException.class.) A base class
          that provides a default implementation for all
          the handlers.

          com/microstar/xml/driver/SAXDriver.class
          A SAX driver for AElfred.

          [Ptolemy Note:  We moved SAXDriver.java into the driver subdirectory
          because 'make fast' runs javac *.java, which was causing problems
          because SAXDriver uses SAX, which we do not ship]

          Neither of the required classes refers to these, and you may leave
          them out of a web installation if you do not need them.


          DEMONSTRATION CLASSES
          ---------------------

          The distribution also contains some classes for the demonstration
          applications.  Normally, you will not include these in a web
          installation:

          XmlApp.class            A simple base class for the demonstrations.

          EventDemo.class         (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
          application showing the XML parse events.

          TimerDemo.class         (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
          application that simply parses a document
          without producing any running output (except
          for errors and warnings); useful for timing
          the parser on different documents.

          DtdDemo.class           (Requires XmlApp.class.) A demonstration
          application that parses a document and prints
          out a normalised version of the document's DTD
          (if any).

          StreamDemo.class        (Requires XmlApp.class.)  A demonstration
          application that parses a document from an
          input stream rather than a URL.


          PARSER QUERY METHODS
          --------------------

          In addition to receiving callbacks, your XmlHandler object can send
          queries about the DTD back to the XmlParser object.  The results of
          these queries are not guaranteed complete until after your handler has
          received a doctypeDecl() event (for details of these query methods,
          see HTML/com.microstar.xml.XmlParser.html):

          package com.microstar.xml.XmlParser;

          public Enumeration declaredElements ()
          public int getElementContentType (String elname)
          public String getElementContentModel (String elname)

          public Enumeration declaredAttributes (String elname)
          public int getAttributeType (String elname, String aname)
          public String getAttributeEnumeration (String elname, String aname)
          public String getAttributeDefaultValue (String elname, String aname)
          public String getAttributeExpandedValue (String elname, String aname)
          public String getAttributeDefaultValueType (String elname, String aname)

          public Enumeration declaredEntities ()
          public int getEntityType (String ename)
          public String getEntityPublicId (String ename)
          public String getEntitySystemId (String ename)
          public String getEntityValue (String ename)
          public String getEntityNotationName (String ename)

          public Enumeration declaredNotations ()
          public String getNotationPublicId (String nname)
          public String getNotationSystemId (String nname)


          CHARACTER ENCODINGS
          -------------------

          ** WARNING: AS REQUIRED BY THE XML SPECIFICATION, AELFRED ASSUMES THAT
          8-BIT CHARACTERS USE UTF-8 ENCODING UNLESS YOU PROVIDE AN
          ENCODING DECLARATION.  UTF-8 IS NOT THE SAME AS
          ISO-8859-1, SO 8-BIT ACCENTED CHARACTERS WILL CAUSE AN
          ERROR UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY DECLARE &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; AS YOUR
          ENCODING.

          The AElfred parser currently supports all of the following input
          encodings:

          UTF-8                   The 8-bit Unicode transformation encoding.
          UTF-16                  The 16-bit Unicode transformation encoding
          (two octet orders).
          ISO-10646-UCS-2         The standard 16-bit Unicode encoding (two
          octet orders).
          ISO-10646-UCS-4         The standard 32-bit Unicode encoding (four
          octet orders).
          ISO-8859-1              The 8-bit standard used in HTML and by Windows
          and Unix.

          If you need only 7-bit characters (i.e. ASCII), you can declare the
          encoding as either &quot;UTF-8&quot; or &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;:

          ?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;

          If you use ISO-8859-1, the parser will run slightly faster, since it
          doesn't need to do any character transformation on input.  If you do
          not declare an encoding, then the parser will (for 7- or 8-bit text)
          default to UTF-8, which will work for ASCII but is slightly slower.

          Since Java has only 16-bit characters, the parser does not resolve
          surrogate pairs in UTF-16; as a result, UTF-16 and UCS-2 are currently
          identical.


          ERRORS AND WARNINGS
          -------------------

          AElfred should always produce correct output for valid and well-formed
          XML documents.  Since AElfred is not a fully conforming XML parser,
          however, it will sometimes accept documents that are not well-formed
          or are not valid, without signaling an error.

          For example, James Clark has a error-reporting test suite available at

          ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/test/xmltest.zip

          These tests cover only well-formedness, not validity.  With the 1997
          version of this package, out of 141 tests AElfred _failed_ to report
          errors for 31 of them:

          002.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
          006.xml                 '--' in comment.
          014.xml                 '' in attribute value
          023.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
          024.xml                 Illegal character at the start of a NAME.
          025.xml                 ']]&gt;' in PCDATA.
          026.xml                 ']]&gt;' in PCDATA.
          029.xml                 ']]&gt;' in PCDATA.
          030.xml                 Illegal XML character (formfeed).
          031.xml                 Illegal XML character (formfeed).
          032.xml                 Illegal XML character (formfeed).
          033.xml                 Illegal XML character (ESC).
          034.xml                 Illegal XML character (formfeed).
          038.xml                 Duplicate attribute assignment.
          069.xml                 Missing space before 'NDATA'.
          070.xml                 '--' in comment.
          074.xml                 Element starting and ending in different entity.
          086.xml                 '[' in public identifier.
          087.xml                 '[' in public identifier.
          088.xml                 ' ' in system literal.
          089.xml                 NDATA parameter entity.
          090.xml                 '' in attribute value.
          091.xml                 NDATA parameter entity.
          096.xml                 Missing space before 'encoding'.
          100.xml                 Wrong case for standalone value.
          104.xml                 Element begins and ends in different entities.
          116.xml                 Reference begins and ends in different entities.
          117.xml                 Reference begins and ends in different entities.
          119.xml                 Reference begins and ends in different entities.
          140.xml                 Illegal character at start of NAME.
          141.xml                 Illegal character in NAME.

          My experiments suggest that reporting all of these errors would add
          10-15K to AElfred's size and slow down parsing by about 15 per cent.


          ABOUT THE NAME &quot;AElfred&quot;
          -----------------------

          AElfred the Great (AElfred in ASCII) was king of Wessex, and at least
          nominally of all England, at the time of his death in 899AD.  AElfred
          introduced a wide-spread literacy program in the hope that his people
          would learn to read English, at least, if Latin was too difficult for
          them.  This AElfred hopes to bring another sort of literacy to Java,
          using XML, at least, if full SGML is too difficult.

          The initial &quot;AE&quot; (&quot;&#198;&quot; in ISO-8859-1) is also a reminder that XML is
          not limited to ASCII.

    <p>
      Apache Ant (<a href="http://ant.apache.org/#in_browser">http://ant.apache.org</a>) 
      is a tool used to compile Java files.
    </p>
    <p>
      org/terraswarm/accessor/JSAccessor.java attempts to execute <code>ant</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>$PTII/bin/ant</code> is a shell script that looks for <code>$PTII/ant/bin/ant</code> 
      and executes it if it is found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason we include <code>ant</code> is to make it easier to install 
      Ptolemy II and CapeCode, especially under Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to ant, we include <code>lib/maven-ant-tasks-2.1.3.jar</code>, 
      which was available at one time from <a href="http://maven.apache.org/components/ant-tasks-archives/ant-tasks-2.1.3/download.cgi#in_browser">http://maven.apache.org/components/ant-tasks-archives/ant-tasks-2.1.3/download.cgi</a>, 
      which also has an Apache 2.0 License.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also included is <code>lib/spotbugs-ant.jar</code>, see below for its 
      LGPL-2.1 license.

        *   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

        *      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        *      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        *      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        *      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        *      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        *      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        *      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        *      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        *      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        *      as of the date such litigation is filed.
        *
        *   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        *      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        *      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        *      meet the following conditions:
        *
        *      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        *          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        *
        *      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        *          stating that You changed the files; and
        *
        *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        *          the Derivative Works; and
        *
        *      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
        *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        *          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        *          as modifying the License.
        *
        *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        *      the conditions stated in this License.
        *
        *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        *
        *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        *
        *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
        *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        *
        *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        *
        *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        *
        *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        *
        *   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright 
      (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth 
      Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and 
      distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is 
      not allowed. (This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
      also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 
      2, hence the version number 2.1.) Preamble The licenses for most 
      software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. 
      By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee 
      your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
      software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General 
      Public License, applies to some specially designated software 
      packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other 
      authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you 
      first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General 
      Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, 
      based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are 
      referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are 
      designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of 
      free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you 
      receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change 
      the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
      informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need 
      to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights 
      or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to 
      certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library 
      or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the 
      library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all 
      the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive 
      or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you 
      must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can 
      relink them with the library after making changes to the library and 
      recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
      rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright 
      the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect 
      each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no 
      warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by 
      someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they 
      have is not the original version, so that the original author's 
      reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by 
      others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
      existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
      cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
      restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any 
      patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent 
      with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU 
      software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
      General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public 
      License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different 
      from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for 
      certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into 
      non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether 
      statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
      legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. 
      The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only 
      if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser 
      General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code 
      with the library. We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public 
      License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
      ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software 
      developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These 
      disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License 
      for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in 
      certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may 
      be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain 
      library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, 
      non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent 
      case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
      libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
      library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
      License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
      non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body 
      of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in 
      non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
      operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating 
      system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of 
      the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is 
      linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that 
      program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and 
      conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close 
      attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a 
      &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the 
      library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order 
      to run. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR 
      COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies 
      to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed 
      by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
      distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
      called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. A &quot;library&quot; 
      means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to 
      be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of 
      those functions and data) to form executables. The &quot;Library&quot;, below, 
      refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed 
      under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the 
      Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
      work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
      modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
      (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
      &quot;modification&quot;.) &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of 
      the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source 
      code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
      associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
      compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than 
      copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; 
      they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the 
      Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered 
      only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent 
      of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
      true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the 
      Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
      Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
      provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
      an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
      all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
      warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. 
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
      you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of 
      it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute 
      such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
      that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must 
      itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to 
      carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date 
      of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
      no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a 
      facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data 
      to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other 
      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must 
      make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application 
      does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
      performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, 
      a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is 
      entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, 
      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table 
      used by this function must be optional: if the application does not 
      supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) 
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and 
      can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
      sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on 
      the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this 
      License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
      whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, 
      it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
      collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of 
      another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work 
      based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium 
      does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You 
      may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
      instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you 
      must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they 
      refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of 
      to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU 
      General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
      instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. 
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
      copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
      subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option 
      is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a 
      program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the 
      Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object 
      code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
      provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding 
      machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms 
      of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
      interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
      to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy 
      the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to 
      distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled 
      to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that 
      contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to 
      work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a 
      &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
      derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of 
      this License. However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the 
      Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
      (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that 
      uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
      Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a 
      &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is 
      part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative 
      work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is 
      true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the 
      Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to 
      be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses 
      only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and 
      small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), 
      then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether 
      it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object 
      code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) 
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
      distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
      Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether 
      or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an 
      exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work 
      that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing 
      portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your 
      choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the 
      customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such 
      modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
      that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
      covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the 
      work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
      copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
      directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of 
      these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes 
      were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 
      above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with 
      the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object 
      code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and 
      then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified 
      Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of 
      definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to 
      recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a 
      suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the 
      library already present on the user's computer system, rather than 
      copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate 
      properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs 
      one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the 
      version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a 
      written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the 
      materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than 
      the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work 
      is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer 
      equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same 
      place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these 
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an 
      executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must 
      include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the 
      executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be 
      distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
      either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, 
      kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
      unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen 
      that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other 
      proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
      system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the 
      Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place 
      library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in 
      a single library together with other library facilities not covered by 
      this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the 
      separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other 
      library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do 
      these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
      same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
      facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
      above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact 
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to 
      find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not 
      copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as 
      expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
      modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and 
      will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, 
      parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License 
      will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain 
      in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, 
      since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you 
      permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
      These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
      Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based 
      on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, 
      and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
      the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the 
      Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically 
      receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link 
      with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You 
      may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
      the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
      compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence 
      of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any 
      other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on 
      you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the 
      conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions 
      of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
      simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
      pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
      Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit 
      royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
      copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could 
      satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
      distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held 
      invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance 
      of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
      intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this 
      section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right 
      claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the 
      sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
      distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. 
      Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
      software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
      application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
      or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a 
      licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make 
      thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of 
      this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
      restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
      interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
      this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
      excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
      among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
      incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
      of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
      versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
      differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is 
      given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a 
      version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later 
      version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
      either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
      Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version 
      number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
      Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
      other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with 
      these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is 
      copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software 
      Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be 
      guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives 
      of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software 
      generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF 
      CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
      APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
      HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT 
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
      LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
      THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 
      THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO 
      EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
      COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE 
      THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
      ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF 
      THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
      LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
      YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY 
      OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
      THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to 
      Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, 
      and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we 
      recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and 
      change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms 
      (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public 
      License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
      library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to 
      most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should 
      have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full 
      notice is found. {description} Copyright (C) {year} {fullname} This

        That said, the java version is so ludicrously outperformed by the C

          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

          &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.

          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:

          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

          (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.

          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:

        Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
        and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

        (or portions thereof).

        (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective
        on the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes
        the Original Software available to a third party under the terms
        of this License.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
        granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software,
        or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the
        Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original
        Software with other software or devices.

        2.2. Contributor Grant.

        Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
        subject to third party intellectual property claims, each
        Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:

        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
        trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,

        created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an
        unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software
        and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

        (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
        of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in

        combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,
        and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that

        in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

        3. Distribution Obligations.

        3.1. Availability of Source Code.

        Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
        available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
        Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
        the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License
        with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software
        You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
        recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to
        how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
        software exchange.

        3.2. Modifications.

        The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
        believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
        You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
        License.

        3.3. Required Notices.

        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
        identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
        remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
        contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
        or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
        the Initial Developer.

        3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
        Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
        of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
        must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
        hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
        such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
        liability terms You offer.

        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
        under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
        Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
        Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
        must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
        this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
        Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
        such terms You offer.

        3.6. Larger Works.

        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
        other code not governed by the terms of this License and
        distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
        You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
        for the Covered Software.

        4. Versions of the License.

        4.1. New Versions.

        Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised
        and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
        version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as
        provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has
        the right to modify this License.

        4.2. Effect of New Versions.

        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
        License under which You originally received the Covered
        Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the
        Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
        otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the
        License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
        available under the terms of the version of the License under
        which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You
        may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of
        the License published by the license steward.

        4.3. Modified Versions.

        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
        license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
        modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
        and remove any references to the name of the license steward
        (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
        (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
        differ from this License.

        5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

        COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &#8220;AS IS&#8221;
        BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
        SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
        COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
        NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
        WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
        ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.

        6. TERMINATION.

        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
        cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
        breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
        beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
        assert such claim is referred to as &#8220;Participant&#8221;) alleging that
        the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
        the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
        the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
        indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
        the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
        under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
        notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
        at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
        Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
        or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

        6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
        alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
        license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
        taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
        payment or license.

        6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
        granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

        7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
        LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
        FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
        LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
        NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
        SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
        SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
        LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
        EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

        8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

        The Covered Software is a &#8220;commercial item,&#8221; as that term is
        defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &#8220;commercial
        computer software&#8221; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. &#167;
        252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &#8220;commercial computer software
        documentation&#8221; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
        (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
        C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
        U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
        rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
        lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
        provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.

        9. MISCELLANEOUS.

        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
        by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
        if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
        conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
        in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
        for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
        reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the
        United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
        of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
        provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
        against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
        that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
        States export administration regulations (and the export control
        laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
        distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

        10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
        indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
        and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
        distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
        of liability.

        NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND
        DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)

        The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of
        the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law
        provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be
        subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
        District of California and the state courts of the State of
        California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.



        The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991

        Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  59 Temple
        Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
        this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

        Preamble

        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
        Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
        change free software--to make sure the software is free for all
        its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
        Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
        authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
        software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
        instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
        charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
        or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
        use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
        do these things.

        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
        for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
        it.

        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
        that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
        get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
        know their rights.

        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
        and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
        copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
        certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
        this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
        and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
        is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others
        will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
        patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
        program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
        the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear
        that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
        licensed at all.

        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

        0. This License applies to any program or other work which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
        distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
        &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work
        based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative
        work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
        Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
        and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
        is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each
        licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
        not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
        of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
        Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
        the Program (independent of having been made by running the
        Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
        absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
        Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
        and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
        for a fee.

        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
        portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy
        and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
        Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
        conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
        not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
        Program is not required to print an announcement.)

        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
        Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
        works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
        apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
        works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
        whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
        the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
        for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
        and every part regardless of who wrote it.

        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
        contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
        intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
        derivative or collective works based on the Program.

        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
        Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
        a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
        other work under the scope of this License.

        3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
        under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
        of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
        following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
        interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
        source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
        plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
        used to control compilation and installation of the
        executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
        distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
        (in either source or binary form) with the major components
        (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
        executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
        executable.

        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
        distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

        4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
        except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
        otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
        void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
        License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
        from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

        5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
        or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
        are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
        License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
        any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
        this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
        copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
        it.

        6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
        the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
        the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
        subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
        further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
        granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
        by third parties to this License.

        7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
        patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
        issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
        agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
        your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
        obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
        Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
        royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
        receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
        way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
        entirely from distribution of the Program.

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
        under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
        intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
        in other circumstances.

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
        any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
        of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
        protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,
        which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have
        made generous contributions to the wide range of software
        distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
        application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide
        if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
        system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
        to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

        8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
        the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
        License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
        in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
        License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
        this License.

        9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
        to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following
        the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
        version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
        does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
        any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

        10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
        free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
        to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
        Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
        status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
        the sharing and reuse of software generally.

        NO WARRANTY

        11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
        LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
        AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
        FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
        DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
        OR CORRECTION.

        12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
        WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
        MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
        INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
        DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
        OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
        OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
        greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this
        is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and
        change under these terms.

        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
        safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
        effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
        have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full
        notice is found.

        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
        does.  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
        published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the
        License, or (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
        General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
        02111-1307 USA

        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
        mail.

        If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
        this when it starts in an interactive mode:

        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to
        redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
        details.

        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
        appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
        commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and
        `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
        suits your program.

        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
        your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the
        program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
        James Hacker.

        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice

        This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
        program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
        library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking
        proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you
        want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of
        this License.

        &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2

        Certain source files distributed by Oracle are subject to the
        following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version
        2, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular
        source file's header the words &quot;Oracle designates this particular
        file as subject to the &quot;Classpath&quot; exception as provided by Oracle
        in the License file that accompanied this code.&quot;

        Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
        is making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms
        and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover
        the whole combination.

        As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
        you permission to link this library with independent modules to
        produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these
        independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
        executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also
        meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions
        of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module
        which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify
        this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
        library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish
        to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

      &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
        as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
        the version number 2.1.]</pre>
      <h3>
        <a id="SEC2">Preamble</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom 
        to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses 
        are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
        software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some 
        specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the 
        Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You 
        can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether 
        this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better 
        strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations 
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, 
        not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
        for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get 
        it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of 
        it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
        you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis 
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave 
        you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source 
        code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide 
        complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them 
        with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
        it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
        library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there 
        is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified 
        by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what 
        they have is not the original version, so that the original author's 
        reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced 
        by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of 
        any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
        effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
        restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that 
        any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be 
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the 
        ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and 
        is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use 
        this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
        libraries into non-free programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a 
        shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a 
        combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary 
        General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the 
        entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General 
        Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with 
        the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it 
        does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General 
        Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less 
        of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages 
        are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
        libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
        special circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to 
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it 
        becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must 
        be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free 
        library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this 
        case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
        software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
        programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of 
        free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in 
        non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
        operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating 
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 
        users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is 
        linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
        that program using a modified version of the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
        modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 
        &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The 
        former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must 
        be combined with the library in order to run.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
          MODIFICATION</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software 
        library or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
        copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
        distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License 
        (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data 
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
        (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work 
        which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the 
        Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under 
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a 
        portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
        straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is 
        included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
        making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means 
        all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated 
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
        compilation and installation of the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 
        running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from 
        such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based 
        on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for 
        writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and 
        what the program that uses the Library does.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
        Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
        provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
        an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep 
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence 
        of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the 
        Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
        you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library 
        or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and 
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
        Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software 
          library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry 
          prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of 
          any change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be 
          licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
          License.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to 
          a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application 
          program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed 
          when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such 
          function or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
          whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          <p>
            (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has 
            a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the 
            application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
            application-supplied function or table used by this function must 
            be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square 
            root function must still compute square roots.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, 
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
        sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
        on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote 
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
        your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
        exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
        collective works based on the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 
        with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of 
        a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
        the scope of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
        General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
        Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
        License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public 
        License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version 
        than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has 
        appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do 
        not make any other change in these notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
        copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
        subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
        Library into a program that is not a library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a 
        portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
        executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided 
        that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from 
        a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
        code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the 
        source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
        source along with the object code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any 
        portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by 
        being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
        Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it 
        contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the 
        library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 
        6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file 
        that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
        derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
        Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be 
        linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The 
        threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
        layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions 
        (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is 
        unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. 
        (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
        will still fall under Section 6.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
        distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
        Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, 
        whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may 
        also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
        to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
        that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit 
        modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 
        engineering for debugging such modifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
        this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work 
        during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
        copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
        directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one 
        of these things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete 
          corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including 
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed 
          under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable 
          linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work 
          that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that 
          the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
          modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
          understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions 
          files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
          application to use the modified definitions.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for 
          linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses 
          at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
          executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
          the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
          version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
          made with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid 
          for at least three years, to give the same user the materials 
          specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the 
          cost of performing this distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by offering 
          access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
          copy the above specified materials from the same place.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a copy 
          of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for 
        reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, 
        the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is 
        normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
        which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
        the executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
        accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
        use both them and the Library together in an executable that you 
        distribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work 
        based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
        other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute 
        such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of 
        the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
        otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of 
          the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other 
          library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the 
          Sections above.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library 
          of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
          explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the 
          same work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
        or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
        or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate 
        your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
        copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
        licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since 
        you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to 
        modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These 
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based 
        on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do 
        so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
        modifying the Library or works based on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any 
        work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
        license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or 
        modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
        impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
        rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
        compliance by third parties with this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
        allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
        to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. 
        If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
        obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, 
        then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For 
        example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
        redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly 
        or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it 
        and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the 
        Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
        any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
        apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
        integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made 
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
        impose that choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
        restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
        this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in 
        or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
        and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
        time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
        version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 
        &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and 
        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
        the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a 
        license version number, you may choose any version ever published by 
        the Free Software Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library 
        into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
        incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. 
        For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
        write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
        for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
        the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
        promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.</strong> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
        THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
        APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT 
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
        LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR 
        A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
        PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE 
        DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
        CORRECTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>16.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
        AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
        MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL 
        OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
        THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
        RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
        FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF 
        SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
        DAMAGES.

        <a id="SEC4">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 
        possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that 
        everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting 
        redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms 
        of the ordinary General Public License).
      </p>
      <p>
        To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It 
        is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
        effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should 
        have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full 
        notice is found.
      </p>
      <pre><var>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.</var>

        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper 
        mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or 
        your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, 
        if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

        patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
        Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
        submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
        the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes

      <p>
        <b>1. DEFINITIONS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contribution&quot; means:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
        documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        i) changes to the Program, and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        ii) additions to the Program;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and 
        are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 
        'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
        Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are 
        separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the 
        Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative 
        works of the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor 
        which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution 
        alone or when combined with the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this 
        Agreement, including all Contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b>
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
        license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
        publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
        object code form.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
        license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
        import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
        any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
        apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
        the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition 
        of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the 
        Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other 
        combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
        licensed hereunder.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
        provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
        patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
        Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
        any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
        or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
        granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility 
        to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
        Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
        to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
        license set forth in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
        under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) its license agreement:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
        Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
        within the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
        Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
        Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
        responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
        like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
        of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
        commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
        create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
        Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
        such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend 
        and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) 
        against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising 
        from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
        against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
        or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
        distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
        obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
        In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
        notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
        allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
        claim at its own expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
        product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
        Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
        claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
        claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
        alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
        defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
        performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
        Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
        must pay those damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5. NO WARRANTY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
        OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
        distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
        exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to 
        the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
        laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
        unavailability or interruption of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
        ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
        WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
        LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
        NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
        DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
        HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>7. GENERAL</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
        the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
        action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
        the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
        software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
        Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of 
        the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
        fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
        Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
        time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
        rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
        granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and 
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
        but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and 
        may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward 
        reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of 
        this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement 
        Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation 
        is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign 
        the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable 
        separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
        distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) 
        may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
        under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
        Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
        Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as 
        expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives 
        no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor 
        under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or 
        otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this 
        Agreement are reserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and 
        the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No 
        party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement 
        more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives 
        its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

      </p>
      <p>
        Exception Intent
      </p>
      <p>
        We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'') 
        applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client 
        libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS 
        licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public 
        License (the ``GPL'').
      </p>
      <h3>
        Legal Terms and Conditions
      </h3>
      As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the 
      GPL:

      <ol>
        <li>
          You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely 
          from the Program and one or more works (each, a &quot;FLOSS Work&quot;) 
          licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 
          1, as long as:<br>a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the 
          Program and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of 
          the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program, and 
          which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in 
          themselves,<br>b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work 
          which are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be 
          considered independent and separate works in themselves,<br>i. are 
          distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and<br>ii. 
          the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied 
          by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those 
          sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the 
          corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and<br>c. 
          any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative 
          Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance 
          with the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate 
          works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program, 
          a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.<br>If the above conditions are 
          not met, then the Program may only be copied, modified, distributed 
          or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL or another valid 
          licensing option from MySQL AB.

        <li>
          Applicability: This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that 
          contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the Program may be 
          distributed under the terms of this FLOSS Exception. If you create 
          or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of both the Program 
          and any other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception 
          is not available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS 
          Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all 
          respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may choose to 
          redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of 
          the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the 
          Program, provided that the copy has never been modified by you or 
          any third party.

        &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

        &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

        &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        </h4>
        <p>
          As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to version 3 of the 
          GNU General Public License.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this License, 
          other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        </p>
        <p>
          An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
          by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
          Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a 
          mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an 
          Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library 
          with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked 
          Version&#8221;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
          Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source 
          code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in 
          isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked 
          Version.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
          object code and/or source code for the Application, including any 
          data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work 
          from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the 
          Combined Work.

        <h4>
          <a name="section1">
          </a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        </h4>
        <p>
          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License 
          without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
          facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an 
          Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed 
          when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the 
          modified version:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort 
            to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the 
            function or data, the facility still operates, and performs 
            whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
          </li>
          <li>
            b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of 
            this License applicable to that copy.

        </h4>
        <p>
          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from 
          a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such 
          object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the 
          incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data 
          structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions 
          and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the 
          following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that 
            the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
            covered by this License.
          </li>
          <li>
            b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
            license document.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          <a name="section4">
          </a>4. Combined Works.
        </h4>
        <p>
          You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, 
          taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the 
          portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse 
          engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of 
          the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that 
            the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
            covered by this License.
          </li>
          <li>
            b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
            license document.
          </li>
          <li>
            c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during 
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among 
            these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the 
            copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          </li>
          <li>
            d) Do one of the following:

            <ul>
              <li>
                0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of 
                this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form 
                suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to 
                recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of 
                the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the 
                manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
                Corresponding Source.
              </li>
              <li>
                1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
                the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run 
                time a copy of the Library already present on the user's 
                computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified 
                version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
                Linked Version.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
          versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may

        <p>
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the

          of the GNU Lesser General Public License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; 
          applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and 
          conditions either of that published version or of any later version 
          published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you 
          received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser 
          General Public License ever published by the Free Software 
          Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide 
          whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
          shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any 
          version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version 
          for the Library.

      <p>
        &quot;Contribution&quot; means:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
        documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      </p>
      <p>
        i) changes to the Program, and
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to 
        the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular 
        Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was 
        added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on 
        such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
        the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in 
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and 
        (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. &quot;Contributor&quot; means any 
        person or entity that distributes the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor 
        which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution 
        alone or when combined with the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
        Agreement.

      <p>
        2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
        license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
        publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
        object code form.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
        license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
        import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
        any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
        apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
        the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition 
        of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the 
        Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other 
        combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
        licensed hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
        provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
        patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
        Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
        any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
        or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
        granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility 
        to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
        Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
        to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
        license set forth in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. REQUIREMENTS
      </p>
      <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
        under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) its license agreement:
      </p>
      <p>
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </p>
      <p>
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      </p>
      <p>
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p>
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
        Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
        within the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
        Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
        Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
        responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
        like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
        of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
        commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
        create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
        Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
        such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend 
        and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) 
        against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising 
        from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
        against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
        or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
        distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
        obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
        In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
        notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
        allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
        claim at its own expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
        product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
        Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
        claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
        claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
        alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
        defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
        performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
        Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
        must pay those damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. NO WARRANTY
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
        OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
        distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
        exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to 
        the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
        laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
        unavailability or interruption of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
        ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
        WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
        LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
        NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
        DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
        HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. GENERAL
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
        the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
        action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
        the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
        software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
        Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of 
        the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
        fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
        Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
        time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
        rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
        granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and 
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
        but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and 
        may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward 
        reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of 
        this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement 
        Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation 
        is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign 
        the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable 
        separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
        distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) 
        may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
        under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
        Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
        Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as 
        expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives 
        no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor 
        under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or 
        otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this 
        Agreement are reserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and 
        the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No 
        party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement 
        more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives 
        its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

        This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the 
        terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, 
        supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

      <h4>
        <a name="section0">
        </a>0. Additional Definitions.
      </h4>
      <p>
        As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to version 3 of the 
        GNU General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other 
        than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
      </p>
      <p>
        An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode 
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an 
        Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library 
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked 
        Version&#8221;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code 
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are 
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data 
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the 
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License 
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

      </h4>
      <p>
        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application 
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the 
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified 
        version:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to 
          ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the 
          function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
          part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        </li>
        <li>
          b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of 
          this License applicable to that copy.

        </a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a 
        header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object 
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated 
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure 
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates 
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the 
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered 
          by this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this

        </a>4. Combined Works.
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken 
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of 
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for 
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that 
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
          covered by this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
          license document.
        </li>
        <li>
          c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during 
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these 
          notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of 
          the GNU GPL and this license document.
        </li>
        <li>
          d) Do one of the following:

          <ul>
            <li>
              0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of 
              this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form 
              suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine 
              or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked 
              Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner 
              specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
              Corresponding Source.
            </li>
            <li>
              1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
              Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a 
              copy of the Library already present on the user's computer 
              system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of 
              the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise 
          be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU 
          GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to 
          install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced 
          by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version 
          of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation 
          Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and 
          Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must 
          provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by 
          section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

      <h4>
        <a name="section5">
        </a>5. Combined Libraries.

      <p>
        You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
        side by side in a single library together with other library 
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this 
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your 
        choice, if you do both of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based 
          on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, 
          conveyed under the terms of this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it 
          is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
          accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        </li>

        <a name="section6">
        </a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
        as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the 
        GNU Lesser General Public License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to 
        it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either 
        of that published version or of any later version published by the 
        Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not 
        specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you 
        may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever 
        published by the Free Software Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide 
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall 
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is 
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

        1. Definitions.

        &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

        &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.

        &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

        &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.

        &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.

        &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

        &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

        &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

        1. Definitions.

        &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

        &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.

        &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

        &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.

        &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.

        &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

        &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

        &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or

        authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
        shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link

        Works thereof.

        irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative
        Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and

        their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
        Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
        submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
        that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
        constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
        patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
        shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

        notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
        that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

        If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
        the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
        modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
        within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
        addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
        additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
        the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
        modifications and may provide additional or different license
        terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
        Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
        provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
        otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
        otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
        in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
        conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
        conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
        supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement
        you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
        trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
        Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in
        describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
        conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
        FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
        determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the
        Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
        permissions under this License.

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
        special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
        arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
        to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
        goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
        and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
        Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and
        charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
        liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on
        Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
        other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
        hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
        claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting
        any such warranty or additional liability.
