<h3><a name="modelTransformation">Model Transformation</a></h3>

<p>The model transformation facility provides a framework for the
analysis and transformation of actor models using model transformation
techniques.

<p>The design of large-scale models poses a number of challenges. As
the size of the models increases to thousands of actors or hundreds of
thousands of actors, analysis and consistent modification on the
models become extremely hard. Furthermore, to maximize component
reuse, a systematic approach is needed for the specification and
maintenance of common patterns in the models and the transformation of
those patterns.

<p>The model transformation framework to be developed in this project
aims to support the flexible specification of patterns and
replacements by means of rules in graph grammar. An intuitive
graphical user interface will be built. For novice users, a set of
common transformations will be included in a library to facilitate
their common tasks.

<p>The transformations are models in their own right. They can be
embedded in larger models hierarchically. Heterogeneous models of
computation can be used to control the application of individual
"atomic" transformations. This makes it easy to create sophisticated
transformations by composing simple ones in a manageable and
disciplined way. The sophisticated transformations will also take
advantage of the concurrency inherent in those models of computation.

<p>Model transformation can be applied as an optimization of modal
models. These are hierarchical state machines with refinements in
their states, which are sub-models to be executed when those states
are active. The current implementation includes the complete
description of each refinement in the model description, even though
refinements of the states in a state machine tend to have large
commonality. With the transformation technique, only one refinement
needs to be stored completely. The others are obtained by
transformations performed on the stored refinement. This eliminates
redundancy and eases the job of modifying multiple refinements
consistently.

<p>Other applications of the model transformation technique include
recognizing common design patterns in the models in a static analysis,
replacing exiting design patterns with more efficient ones, and
reusing design patterns by incorporating them into new models.

<h3><a name="pteraDomain">Ptera (Ptolemy Event Relationship Actor) Domain</a></h3>

<p>The Ptera (Ptolemy Event Relationship Actor) domain is a discrete-event model of computation. A model in Ptera is represented with a graph of nodes and edges, where nodes represent events and directed edges between events represent scheduling relation. One or more events can be selected as initial events, which are scheduled
at model time 0.0. When an event is fired, it possibly performs certain actions, and if there are outgoing edges from that event, the events at the end points of those edges are scheduled after non-negative delays. One or more events can also be selected as final events. The firing of final events causes the event
queue to be emptied after their actions are performed, and therefore no more events can be processed.

<p>The Ptera domain supports a different kind of modal models called PteraModalModels, compared to modal models using FSMs (Finite State Machines) as the control. A PteraModalModel uses Ptera at the top level, and each event is refined into a sub-model. The refinements can use Ptera and any other Ptolemy models of computation.

<p>A Ptera model is timed. Although it should work in many domains, the DE (Discrete-Event) domain or Ptera domain itself are recommended. When embedded in those domains, the scheduling of the Ptera model is delegated to the container by calling the fireAt() function of its director.

<p>There are many useful additional features for Ptera, such as canceling edges and parameters. A canceling edge, denoted by a dotted line, cancels a previously scheduled event instead of scheduling a new one. If the pointed to event has multiple instances in the event queue, then the first instance is cancelled.
Events may also have parameters, and the actual values for those parameters are specified by the expressions on the edges that schedule them. Those expressions are evaluated at run-time. The events may refer to the values of those parameters in their actions by parameter names.

<h3><a name="causalityanalysis">Causality Analysis</a></h3>
Ptolemy II 8.0 includes an update to our Causality Analysis framework.
We identified performance problems with our current
non-conservative causality analysis for modal models within
discrete-event (DE) systems. In this scheme, causality analysis is
performed on the entire model at run time each time there is a mode
change in the model. This mechanism is far too costly. We are
investigating techniques for performing the causality analysis in a
compositional way for the various modes at compile
time. Unfortunately, brute force solutions result in exponentially
growing memory requirements for the results of the causality analysis.

<p>We designed, implemented and reviewed an interface that defines a
causality interfaces for actor networks as described in the paper
"<a href="#ZhouLee:08:CausalityInterfaces">Causality Interfaces for Actor Networks</a>."

<p>Causality interfaces are also described in Ye Zhou Ph.D. Thesis,
"<a href="#Zhou:07:Interface">Interface Theories for Causality Analysis in Actor Networks.</a>"


<p>Causality interfaces represent dependencies between input and output
ports of an actor and can be used to perform scheduling or static
analysis on actor models.  

<p>This substantial new work helps address performance problems in
large Discrete Event (DE) models.  The new work provides
more efficient static analysis for directed cycles and scheduling.
This work solved a bug concerning execution time with DE models
that had many actors at one level of hierarchy.  The table
below illustrates the improvement.

<p>    One of the challenges in complex, heterogeneous models is that
   portions of the model have temporal behavior while other portions
   are purely functional. We have reworked the interfaces that
   hierarchically heterogeneous models in Ptolemy II present to one
   another for managing the passage of time. This rework supports
   much more robust multithreaded and distributed execution without
   compromising temporal coherence. Concretely, we have defined a
   formalism whereby a model requests temporal behavior of its
   container in the hierarchy, and the container responds with an
   indication of the extent to which it can honor the request.  If
   the extent is sufficient for the application, then the models are
   compatibly composed. Otherwise, they are not, and the model is
   marked defective.

<h3><a name="continuousModal">Continuous and Modal Domains</a></h3>
<p>Ptolemy II 8.0 includes a substantial rework of modal models and
the underlying finite state machine infrastructure to make them work
predictably and consistently across domains.</p>

<p>Ptolemy II 8.0 includes a new implementation of continuous-time models
based on the semantics given in "<a href="#LeeZheng:07:Leveraging">Synchronous Language Principles for Heterogeneous Modeling
and Design of Embedded Systems</a>." In particular, the Continuous domain cleanly supports
continuous-time models (using an ODE solver), discrete-event models,
and arbitrary mixtures of the two, including signals that combine
continuous-time segments with discrete events. It also interoperates
cleanly with most other domains (pretty much all except PN and
Rendezvous, for which there does not appear to be reasonable semantic
model of such an interaction). Modal models are also cleanly supported
with the Continuous domain, enabling hybrid system modeling with a
rigorous semantics. The Continuous domain is expected to eventually
replace CT.</p>

<h2><a name="other">Other Key New Capabilities</a></h2>
<ul>
<li> New width inference algorithm
<br>Relations have a width specifying the number of channels of that relation.
Having to explicitly specify this width can be a tedious job. To make it even
worse, the addition of one relation to a multiport might result in a model
builder needing to go through the model again to adapt widths. To cope
with this you can now set the width to <i>Auto</i>. In this case the width of the relation
is inferred from other relations or other ports with a graph algorithm. This
algorithm removes a lot of restriction that were present in the previous implementation.
In this implementation we tried to
come up with a solution that can infer the width of all relations for most scenarios without
imposing a large performance cost. The algorithm propagates the widths
it knows and at multiports tries to infer the widths of other relations from
these propagated widths.</p>
<p>For certain actors there is a relation between the widths of the input ports
and the widths of the output ports. To resolve this problem, <i>width constraints</i> on
ports have been introduced. There exists two types of width constraints.
The first one imposes an equality constraints between two different ports. With the second type of constraints you can set the width of a port equal to
a certain parameter.</p>

<p>The last step of the algorithm is a <i>consistency check</i> in which it is checked
that the solution obtained by the width inference algorithm is a unique one.
A non unique solution is treated as a error. </p>

<p>In this release the default width has also been changed from <i>1</i> to <i>Auto</i>.
<br>(Bert Rodiers) </p>
</li>

<li> <i>New model generators for verification</i>.
<p> This release contains capabilities to generate, from Ptolemy models, other types of models,
suitable for formal verification. In particular, the <i>Formal Model Converter</i> component
(developed by Chihhong Patrick Cheng) allows to generate models compatible with the SMV or NuSMV 
model-checkers, from Ptolemy models in the SR domain. Also, the <i>RTMaudeCodeGenerator</i> component
(developed by Kyungmin Bae) allows to generate models compatible with the Real Time Maude tool,
from Ptolemy models in the DE domain.

<li><i><a name="configurableui">Configurable User Interface</a></i>
<br>GUI (graphical user interface) properties allow Ptolemy II users or redistributors
to configure the Ptolemy user interface by simply making changes to configuration
files in the XML format. For example, buttons on the tool bar or menu items specific
to a certain application domain can be added that trigger user-defined actions. Those
actions may be defined in Java classes or as MoML change requests to be applied to the
model being edited.

<li><i><a name="threadedcomposite">ThreadedComposite</a></i>
<br>The ThreadedComposite actor supports execution of either an atomic actor
or a composite actor in a separate thread. It thus brings multithreading
to Ptolemy domains where the director does not use threads, such as
DE, SR, and SDF.  The actor can be used to get parallel execution on
multicore machines, to execute actors that block on I/O without blocking
the model execution, and to execute actors in the background.

<li><i>Lazy Opening of Composites</i>
<br>
LazyTypedCompositeActor is a replacement for TypedCompositeActor that does lazy evaluation, which means that he contents of a LazyTypedCompositeActor are not evaluated at runtime, instead they are evaluated at start up time.  LazyTypedCompositeActor was developed to improve the opening time of very large models. One issue is that this changes the results slightly because different results will occur if the results depend on the order in which actors are created. Unforuntately, the scheme we have for setting seeds in the random number generator "deterministically" has this property.

<li><i>printPDF</i>
<br>Vergil and Ptplot now handle an optional <code>-printPDF</code>
command line argument.  This option finds the first printer with the
string <code>PDF</code> in the name and then prints to that printer.
Thus, <code>-printPDF</code> requires that the full (non-free) version of
Adobe Acrobat be installed, or some other method of printing to PDF.
Unfortunately, the location of the resulting PDF file is not easily
controlled, on the Mac look in <code>~/Documents/Java Printing.pdf</code>.

 <li> Level-crossing links are now correctly exported
   to MoML.  The way this works is that the lowest common
   container of the objects being linked is responsible for
   producing the MoML description of the link. This ensures
   that when the MoML is encountered for creating the link,
   that both objects being linked have already been created. 

  <li>Various classes were moved to make the dependencies between packages cleaner.  In general, the
  <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/moml/filter/ClassChanges.html">ptolemy.moml.filter.ClassChanges</a> to handle the changes
  that will appear in MoML files.

<li> A few features and classes were removed outright.
<ul>
 <li>ptolemy/copernicus/{java,c,actor} were removed because the Ptolemy kernel has evolved and maintaining Copernicus
  was too timeconsuming.

  <li>ptolemy.domains.continuous.lib.ZeroCrossingDetector was removed because it had cloning problems because
  of how it extended a class and removed a parameter.

  <li>ptolemy.domains.curriculum.DependencyHighlighter was removed, use
