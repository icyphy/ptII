    <h1><a name="SettingUp">Setting up Eclipse to manage your Ptolemy II development environment</a></h1>

    <p>Eclipse will manage your ptII code tree as a <em>project</em> called
      the ptII project.  </p>
    <p>The Ptolemy II source code is available in two formats:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The stable release - download a tar file that is created annually.</li>
      <li>The development version - access the Ptolemy group version control system, available via Github.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The advantage of the tar file is that it is tested and stable.</p>
    <p>The advantage of the development version is that it has the
      latest and greatest changes.  However, there could be bugs and
      instability in the development version.

    <!--/eclipseSimple-->
    <p>There several ways to set up the ptII project:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> <a href="noVC.htm" target="main">Eclipse is unaware of the version control aspects of the project.</a>
	<br/>If you are downloading the source from major Ptolemy release,
	and don't want to update regularly, or you do not have network access, then use this choice.
	<br/><i>(No Eclipse Subversion plug-in (Subversive),
	No Subversion (<code>svn</code>) from the command line).</i>
      </li>

      <li> <a href="noEclipseSVN.htm" target="main">Eclipse is unaware of the version control aspects of the project, use the shell version of Subversion to update the tree.</a>

	<br/><i>(No Eclipse Subversion plug-in (Subversive),
	use Subversion (<code>svn</code>) from the command line).</i>
      </li>

      <li> <a href="eclipseSVN.htm" target="main">Eclipse is aware of the Subversion aspects of the project.</a> 
	<br/><i>(Use both the Eclipse Subversion plug-in (Subversive) and the
	shell <code>svn</code> command).</i>

	<br/>This choice is the <b>preferred</b> choice for collaborating with the Ptolemy group because it means that your Ptolemy II tree can get recent changes.
	<br/>The downside is that that the development tree is under development, so there may be bugs or instability.

      </li>

    </ol>

    <!--/eclipseSimple-->
    <p>Without the Eclipse Subversive plug-in, you'll need to manage the Subversion aspects in the
      usual way, i.e. with Subversion commands being submitted to a bash
      shell.  With Subversive, Eclipse will do all sorts of things to "help"
      you. Most of these things are good, but there is a learning curve.</p>


    <p>Please choose <b>one</b> of the methods above to set up Eclipse for Ptolemy II.
