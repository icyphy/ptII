# $PTII/lib/ptII.properties
# $Id$
# Properties set by configure for use when starting up.
# 
# If this file is named "ptII.properties", don't edit it!
# Instead edit ptII.properties.in and run "cd $PTII;./configure"
# configure reads in $PTII/lib/ptII.properties.in,
# substitutes in variables that are surrounded with @,
# and generated $PTII/lib/ptII.properties.in
#
# We use a properties file here so that we can easily start Ptolemy II
# without passing lots of command line arguments.  However, when
# running "vergil -sandbox" or "vergil -policyfile ...", merging
# properties from ptII.properties.in might not work.
#
# The format of this file is documented in the java.util.Properties
# Javadoc page, for example
# http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html
#
# This file is read in by VergilApplication.mergePropertiesFile().
# Properties listed in this file do not override preexisting properties.
# To view the properties, start up vergil, do 
# File -> New -> Graph Editor -> View -> JVM Properties
