/** The is the implementation of another deterministic temporal semantics.
 * 
 *  This module provides Accessors with deterministic temporal semantics, 
 *  that are aligned with Cape Code's semantics. This module is to be explored 
 *  by commonHost, so that any swarmlet host will enjoy these features.
 *  For this, accessors calls to setTimeout() or setInterval() are binded, 
 *  respectively, to this module's setTioumetDet() and setIntervalDet(). It is 
 *  guaranteed that only one timeout (function provided by the host) is pending  
 *  at any time and that callbacks will be executing with respect to their  
 *  logical clock domains and their relative priority and/or arrival time.
 *  
 *  For this implementation, we assume that there is the physical time line, 
 *  together with many logical time lines. All time lines do not advance the same 
 *  way. Physical time is continuous and has the same rate, while logical time is 
 *  updated at particular instances.
 *  
 *  Each logical time line is associated with a 'labeled logical clock domains'
 *  (LLCD). This allows for defining and implementing logical simultaneity of 
 *  callbacks execution. 
 *
 *  The basic idea is to define each delayed callback with an LLCD. Two delayed 
 *  callbacks with the same LLCD share the same logical time line. If they have
 *  the same logical time execution, then they will execute atomically one after 
 *  another, such that their arrival order is respected. That is, if the instruction
 *  setInterval(F, T, 'A') was called before setInterval(G, T, 'A'), and no other
 *  action involving the LLCD 'A' has happened in between, then when F executes, it 
 *  will be immediately followed by G.  
 *  
 *  When a call to the binded setTimeout or setInterval occurs, then scheduling the 
 *  execution will depend on the LLCD. If it is a new one, then a new LLCD is created
 *  and its current logical time is set to the current physical time. However, if the 
 *  LLCD is already defined, then the current logical time of that clock domain is 
 *  used. In either cases, the callback will execute at its LLCD logical current time 
 *  plus the timeout. 

 *  Labeled logical clock domain are strings. However, if the programmer unintentionally
 *  or intentionally do not provide one, then a new anonymous clock domain is created 
 *  with its logical time origin set to the current real time (approximately). The new
 *  anonymous clock doamin is unique and is generated by incrementing defaultLabelIndex.
 *  An exception is that if llcd is not given and timeout is zero, then a single shared 
 *  zero-delay clock domain is used.
 *  This exception is used to request an execution as soon as possible, before any
 *  callbacks in other clock domains are invoked. If there are multiple such zero-timeout
 *  anonymous llcd callbacks, then the order of their invocation will be determined by
 *  their priority, if one is given, and by the order of the request, if no priority
 *  is given or if a priority matches another priority.   
 *
 *  This implementation was preceded by a another one that adopts a slightly different
 *  semantics for the execution. In the previous version, any two callbacks with the 
 *  same label execute starting from the same reference point in time. In addition,
 *  there are only two time lines: the physical one and the logical one. Therefore,
 *  delayed callbacks execute only with respect to the logical one. This way, the inter
 *  execution time is always respected. The drawback is that additional delays are 
 *  added.
 *  
 *  For the purpose of implementing temporal semantics, we record all delayed callBacks
 *  in the 'delayedCallbacks' object. This object is accessed by label. Within a 
 *  labeled object, we record the current logical execution time, and the group of 
 *  delayed callbacks having the same label. A new delayedCallback object is added 
 *  to delayedCallbacks, given its label. In addition, each new object is uniquely 
 *  identified by a number (generated by automatically incrementing cbIdentifier). 
 *  Consequently, the identifier reflects the order in which the calls to setTimeout 
 *  or setInterval occurred. This number is returned and is to be used for clearing 
 *  the corresponding timer. This happens each time setTimeoutDet() or seIntervalDet() 
 *  is called. 
 *  
 *  For the sake of any system that may need to define execution order based on 
 *  predefined/precomputed priorities, it is possible to pass the priority 
 *  as an argument to setTimeout or setInterval. Consequently, the third level of
 *  delayed callbacks ordering will be, first, based on priorities, then on arrival
 *  time (reflected by the identifiers). For the case of Accessors, the priority will
 *  be inherited from the accessor's priority (if defined).
 *  
 *  
 *  In order to make the process fast, the list 'callbackQueue' keeps an incremental 
 *  next execution time sorted list of pointers to the delayed callbacks. Pointers
 *  are objects with two attributes: the labeled clock domain and the identifier.
 *  This list, has three levels of sorting. The first one is obviously the execution
 *  time. If two or more callbacks have the same execution time, they are ordered by 
 *  their labels origin. This is the second level of sorting. Finally, the third one is 
 *  the callbacks ordering, reflected by the identifiers. 
 *  
 *  A delayed callback has the following attributes: 
 *   *  callbackFunction: the callback function, which will be invoked once or periodically,
 *      depending on the value of the repeat parameter.
 *   *  interval: The time until the first (or only) execution of the callback.
 *      This is a non-negative number interpreted as milliseconds
 *      (a negative number will be treated as zero).
 *      This is a logical time, relative to the current logical time of the llcd.
 *      If the llcd is null or has never before been created, then a new llcd will be
 *      created and its logical time will be set to (approximately) the current physical time.
 *   *  periodic: if set to true, the callback needs to execute every interval time,
 *      otherwise, it executes only once. A boolean specifying whether the callback should 
 *      be invoked just once (with value false) or repeatedly, periodically, until stopped 
 *      (with value true).
 *   *  nextExecutionTime: records the next time at which the callback should be
 *      executed.
 *   *  priority is an optional attribute for the priority over other delayed callbacks
 *      that use the same llcd and are scheduled to occur at the same logical time.
 *      This is either null or an integer, where a lower value means higher priority.
 *      If two priorities match, then the order of invocation matches the order in which
 *      requests are made (by calling this function).
 *   *  errorCallback is an optional attribute that provides a callback to execute in case
 *      the delayed callback's execution throws an error. If no callback is specified, then
 *      if the delayed callback throws an error, then the error message and stack trace
 *      will be printed to the console and execution will continue.
 *   *  doneCallback is an optional attricute that provides the callback to execute after 
 *      the delayed callback has executed successfully. If repeat is true, then this callback
 *      will be invoked after each successful invocation of of the callback argument function.
 *        
 *  Proof: Done! Using Real-Time Maude :-)

 *  attribute set to false. The following function implements the core common behavior, 
 *  while setting periodic to the value it should be. Therefore, setIntervalDet and 
 *  setTimeoutDet just call this function with the right parameters.
 *  
 *  @param callback The callback function, which will be invoked once or periodically,
 *   depending on the value of the repeat parameter.
 *  @param timeout The time until the first (or only) execution of the callback.
 *   This is a non-negative number interpreted as milliseconds
 *   (a negative number will be treated as zero).
 *   This is a logical time, relative to the current logical time of the llcd.
 *   If the llcd is null or has never before been created, then a new llcd will be
 *   created and its logical time will be set to (approximately) the current physical time.
 *  @param repeat A boolean specifying whether the callback should be invoked just once
 *   (with value false) or repeatedly, periodically, until stopped (with value true).
 *   To stop it, call clearTick(), passing the returned handle.
 *  @param llcd An optional argument giving the labeled logical clock domain
 *   label as a string. If no llcd argument is given (the argument is null or undefined),
 *   then a new anonymous clock domain is created with its logical time origin set to the
 *   current real time (approximately). An exception is that if llcd is not given and
 *   timeout is zero, then a single shared zero-delay clock domain is used.
 *   This exception is used to request an execution as soon as possible, before any
 *   callbacks in other clock domains are invoked. If there are multiple such zero-timeout
 *   anonymous llcd callbacks, then the order of their invocation will be determined by
 *   their priority, if one is given, and by the order of the request, if no priority
 *   is given or if a priority matches another priority.
 *  @param priority An optional argument for the priority over other delayed callbacks
 *   that use the same llcd and are scheduled to occur at the same logical time.
 *   This is either null or an integer, where a lower value means higher priority.
 *   If two priorities match, then the order of invocation matches the order in which
 *   requests are made (by calling this function).
 *  @param errorCallback An optional argument that provides a callback to execute in case
 *   the delayed callback's execution throws an error. If no callback is specified, then
 *   if the delayed callback throws an error, then the error message and stack trace
 *   will be printed to the console and execution will continue.
 *  @param doneCallback An optional argument that provides the callback to execute after 
 *   the delayed callback has executed successfully. If repeat is true, then this callback
 *   will be invoked after each successful invocation of of the callback argument function.
 *  @return An integer that is the unique ID of the new delayed callback.
