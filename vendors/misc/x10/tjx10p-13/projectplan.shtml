    <td class="body">The purpose of this page is to provide a current plan of what is to come
    for The Java X10 Project.<h3>1.&nbsp; Modular UI</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:&nbsp; </strong>I would like to create a modular AWT interface that
    can automatically construct ApplianceUnitPanel, LightUnitPanel, and MasterUnitPanel
    classes and add them to a frame based on an ini file. The ini file would specify tuples
    consisting of the UnitPanel class to construct and the module code (ie A1 or B6) for any
    devices you wish to include. Also, this would include the ability to incorporate any of
    your own extensions to the UnitPanel class without modification or recompilation of the
    UI.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> This mini-project has not yet been started.</p>
    <h3>2.&nbsp; X10 MP3UnitPanel</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:&nbsp; </strong>This is a UnitPanel that has the ability to play an
    M3U playlist. The X10 Dim and Bright commands are used to advance and return to the
    various tracks, and the X10 On and Off commands are equivalent to play and pause.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> This is actually complete and already working on my testbed,
    but it still needs quite a bit of work for efficiency as well as needing to be cleaned up
    for re-use purposes. Also I need to clean it up before I publish it.</p>
    <h3>3.&nbsp; X10 Logger</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:&nbsp; </strong>This is an implementation of the x10.UnitListener
    interface that simply logs date and time followed by the command issued to a log file.
    This will actually be fairly simple to implement and shouldn't take much time. The reason
    I personally look forward to this one is not actually for debugging reasons though it will
    help in that area as well. The use that I have for this, is that by using this in
    conjunction with X10's hawkeye motion detector, I will have an effective log of when
    someone enters or exits my home.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> This mini-project has not yet been started.</p>
    <h3>4.&nbsp; TW523SerialController</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:&nbsp; </strong>Serial Controller for the TW523 Controller.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> This mini-project has not yet been started.</td>
