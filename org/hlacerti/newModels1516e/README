Ptolemy 1516e uses new HLA types:

Simple types : 
	boolean -> HLAboolean
	unsigned_byte -> HLAbyte
	double -> HLAfloat62BE
	float -> HLAfloat32BE
	int -> HLAinteger32BE
	long -> HLAinteger64BE
	short -> HLAinteger16BE
	string -> HLASCIIstring

Array : 
FixedArray and VariableArray
The difference between the 2 types is that VariableArray know and encode its size, and FixedArray don't
Ptolemy use only one type of Array (ArrayType) and we encode/decode it with VariableArray.

* To sent/receive Array with Ptolemy, we must use format this input to received VariableArray, with this format :
[type] OR arrayType(type)
For example : [int] OR arrayType(int)

* Ptolemy can aslo received FixedArray already encoded, but can't encode FixedArray itself.
To receive a FixedArray, you have to use this format :
[type, size] OR arrayType(type, size).
For example : [int, 3] or arrayType(int, 3)

WARNING : if you try to use [type, size] to decode a VariableArray, the result will be wrong.
Sometimes, during the execution, Ptolemy "save" the type at the format [type, size], and even if it write type is [type], it doesn't work. To fix this, the type format have to be set in Customize/Port/Type.
