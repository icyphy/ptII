/** Module for HTTP clients. Supports get, put and post methods.
 *  
 *  Depends on cordova-plugin-advanced-http. To install run 
 *  &lt;pre>
 *  cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-advanced-http
 *  &lt;/pre>
 *
 *  A nominal usage example is:
 *  &lt;pre>
 *  httpClient.get({
 *  		trustAll: true,
 *      	url: "https://www.google.com"
 *   	},
 *   	function(response) {
 *      	console.log(response.body);
 *   	}
 *  );
 *  &lt;/pre>
 *  
 *  Many of the features of http-client modules for Cape Code and Node hosts are not
 *  supported in this module due to limitiations in the plugin. Places in the documentation where
 *  this implementation cannot meet the API of the other versions are marked with FIXMEs 
 *
 *  FIXME: POST commands are implemented with XMLHttpRequest, which is inconsistent with all the
 *  other http commands. 
 *
 *  FIXME: PUT commands only accept stringified JSON objects as the body
 *  They are sent as json or url encoding depending on this implementation of http-client's
 *  special option: "encoding". Blame cordova-plugin-advanced-http.
 * 
 *  Both http and https are supported.
 *
 *  @module http-client
 *  @author  Matt Weber, Chadlia Jerad, and Hokeun Kim
 *  @version $$Id: http-client.js 75980 2017-04-23 00:19:25Z beth@berkeley.edu $$

/** Issue an HTTP request and provide a callback function for responses.
 *  The callback is a function that is passed an instance of IncomingMessage,
 *  defined here. This function returns an instance of ClientRequest, also defined here.
 *  The HTTP request will not actually be issued until you call the end() function on
 *  the returned ClientRequest.
 *
 *  This implementation ensures that for any accessor that calls this function,
 *  the callback functions are called in the same order as
 *  invocations of this request() function that triggered the request.
 *  If you call this function from the same accessor before the previous
 *  request has been completed (the callback function has been called or it has
 *  timed out), then the request will be queued to be issued only after the previous
 *  request has been satisfied.
 *
 *  The options argument can be a string URL
 *  or a map with the following fields (this helper class assumes
 *  all fields are present, so please be sure they are):
 *  &lt;ul>
 *  &lt;li> trustAll: FIXME THIS IS A CORDOVA EXCLUSIVE OPTION.
 *       Accept all SSL certificates. Or disable accepting all certificates. Defaults to false.
 *  &lt;li> validateDomainName: FIXME THIS IS A CORDOVA EXCLUSIVE OPTION.
 *       Whether or not to validate the domain name in the certificate. Defaults to true.
 *  &lt;li> encoding: FIXME: THIS IS ONLY A CORDOVA ISSUE
 *       For put and post requests, cordova-plugin-advanced-http only supports
 *       JSON and url encodings. Possible values are "json" and "urlencoded". "json" is default. See. 
 *       https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-advanced-http-custom-error#setdataserializer
 *  &lt;li> body: The request body, if any. FIXME: This should support all strings and image data
 *       but doesn't. It only supports stringified JSON objects (not stringified strings!).
 *       These are either url or json encoded in the body depending on the value of the Cordova-only
 *       special "encoding" option. Default is json encoding.
 *  &lt;li> headers: An object containing request headers. By default this
 *       is an empty object. Items may have a value that is an array of values,
 *       for headers with more than one value.
 *  &lt;li> keepAlive: FIXME: The value true is not supported by the cordova http plugin!
 *       In other hosts, this is a boolean
 *       that specifies whether to keep sockets around
 *       in a pool to be used by other requests in the future. This defaults to false.
 *  &lt;li> method: FIXME: The only supported HTTP request methods in this module are 'GET', 'PUT', and 'POST'.
 *       Defaults to 'GET'. In other hosts more methods may be supported.
 *  &lt;li> outputCompleteResponseOnly: FIXME: The value false is not supported by the cordova http plugin! 
 *       In other hosts, if false, then the multiple invocations of the
 *       callback may be invoked for each request. This defaults to true, in which case
 *       there will be only one invocation of the callback.
 *  &lt;li> timeout: FIXME: This parameter is ignored by the cordova http plugin! 
 *       In other hosts, the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for a response
 *       before triggering a null response and an error. This defaults to 5000.
 *  &lt;li> url: A string that can be parsed as a URL, or an object containing
 *       the following fields:
 *       &lt;ul>
 *       &lt;li> host: A string giving the domain name or IP address of
 *            the server to issue the request to. This defaults to 'localhost'.
 *       &lt;li> path: Request path as a string. This defaults to '/'. This can
 *            include a query string, e.g. '/index.html?page=12', or the query
 *            string can be specified as a separate field (see below).
 *            An exception is thrown if the request path contains illegal characters.
 *       &lt;li> protocol: The protocol. This is a string that defaults to 'http'.
 *       &lt;li> port: Port of remote server. This defaults to 80. Using the defaultwill probably yield
 *            undesired behavior if the specified protocol isn't http.
 *       &lt;li> query: A query string to be appended to the path, such as '?page=12'.
 *       &lt;/ul>
 *  &lt;/ul>
 *  @param options The options or URL.
 *  @param responseCallback The callback function to call with an instance of IncomingMessage,
 *   or with a null argument to signal an error.
 *  @return An instance of ClientRequest.
