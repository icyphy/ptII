end in "#in_browser" using the web browser.  For example, from within

will open up the Ptolemy website using the operating system web browser.

<p>The ptolemy.actor.gui.BrowswerLauncher class implements this functionality.
This class has the following license.

 <p> On November 3, 2003, BrowserLauncher was downloaded from 
 <a href="http://browserlauncher.sourceforge.net/#in_browser" target="_top">http://browserlauncher.sourceforge.net/</a>.
That URL no longer exists, there is a replacement package which is LGPL'd.
