<h1>Continuous Domain</h1>

<p>The Continuous Time Model of Computation defines a semantics used
for continuous-time simulations. Continuous Time models consist of
Actors that have continuous time signals as their inputs and outputs,
and may have a state that changes over time advancement. These actors
are connected by relations denoting particular signals. At a sequence
of time increments, the values of all signals are determined using a
continuous time solving algorithm. If a given precision cannot be
accomplished, finer time increments are used adaptively.</p>

<p>The domain models systems with continuous dynamics, including for
example analog circuits and mechanical systems, but also cleanly
supports discrete events, modal behaviors, and signals that mix
continuous-time behaviors with discrete events. Models for continuous
dynamics are equivalent to linear or nonlinear integral equations. A
sophisticated numerical solver for these equations is integrated with
the director. The clean semantics of the Continuous domain enables its
integration in hierarchical heterogeneous models that use the
Synchronous/Reactive (SR) and Discrete Event (DE) domains. Arbitrary
hierarchical mixtures of these domains are supported, although if SR
is at the top level, then the period parameter of the director must be
used so that time advances. Domain interactions are documented in Lee
and Zheng, 2007.</p>
