<h1>NewtonsCradleComplicated</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.

<p>This is a modified version of the Newton's cradle demo that
shows a more complicated dynamic behavior. The key change 
is the initial states of balls. In this demo, both ball #1 and 
ball #2 are moved away from their equilibrium positions 
but start at different angles of PI/8 and PI/16.</p>

<p>Because the period of a pendulum depends on not only its 
sizes but also the initial angle, ball #1 and #2 do not reach 
their equilibrium positions at the same time. Therefore, 
the collisions between ball #1 and #2 and between ball #2 
and #3 do not happen at the exactly same time. This makes 
the model's dynamics complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, because ball #2 has a smaller initial angle than
that of ball #1, its period is smaller. Therefore, ball #2 first 
collides with ball #3, then with ball #1, and then with ball #3 
again. All these collisions happen at different times. Zoom in 
the velocities plot for a better understanding of this.</p>
