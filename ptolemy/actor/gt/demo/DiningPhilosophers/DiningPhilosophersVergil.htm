<h1>DiningPhilosophers</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.

<p>This model demonstrates the use of TransformationRule actors
together with PortParameters.  Initially, an empty model named
"DiningPhilosophers" is generated by the ModelGenerator. A single
dining philosopher with a fork is added to that empty model with the
TransformationRule actor named "CreateFirst." The model is then passed
to a loop, which adds n-1 philosophers and n-1 forks to it, one of
each in each iteration. Each created philosopher is assigned a unique
ID, which is generated by the Ramp and read into the second
TransformationRule actor via a PortParameter. The up-to-date value of
the PortParameter is used by the AttributeOperation in the Philosopher
CompositeActor in the Replacement part. (Open the CreateOne actor,
switch to the Replacement tab, right click on the Philosopher actor,
and choose Customize->Operations.)</p>
