<p>
In theory, Java programs are "write once, run everywhere." In practice,
Java programs are somewhat less platform dependent than other programs,
but they are still platform dependent. Java programs that run under a web
browser, like Netscape or Internet Explorer, are called <I>applets</I>.
Whether an applet runs correctly depends on the version of the browser,
the operating system, the version of the operating system, and even the
hardware configuration. Collectively, all these parameters are called the
<I>platform</I>.

<P>The Ptolemy II applets have been tested with a very limited number
of platforms. This page is intended to help you diagnose
problems. Please send email to 
<A HREF="mailto:ptII@eecs.berkeley.edu">ptII@eecs.berkeley.edu</A> if you
find errors or can suggest additions to this page.

<H3>General assumptions</H3>
We assume that you are running under a standard browser with Java applets
enabled, and that your computer has sound capability supported by Java.
Most modern PCs and workstations with reasonably recent versions of the
standard browsers (Netscape and Internet Explorer) meet these requirements.
<H3>
<A NAME="jdk"></A>Java version</H3>
Most of the applets on these pages require JDK 1.1 (JDK stands for the
Java Development Kit). JDK 1.1 is supported by Netscape 4.06 and higher,
and Internet Explorer 4.0 and higher.

<P>If your browser does not support JDK 1.1, you might see the following
message in your Java console window (which you can open under Netscape's
"Communicator" menu):
<PRE># Applet exception: error: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
&nbsp;&nbsp; java.awt.TextArea: method &lt;init> (Ljava/lang/String;III)V not found</PRE>
To get JDK 1.1 to work with Netscape 4.03
- 4.05, you need to download a patch. The patch can be found at <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/software/jdk/download.html">the <CODE>developer.netscape.com</CODE> download page</A>.

<H3>Diagnosing problems</H3>
Under Netscape, under the Communicator menu, there is an item called "Java
Console." Select that to read error messages that occur while an attempt
is being made to run an applet. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer (version
4.0) does not have a facility for looking at Java error messages, so if
you are having trouble, we suggest using Netscape instead.

<P>Unfortunately, the Java virtual machine often produces some pretty useless
error messages. For example, "class not found" could mean almost anything.
It roughly translates as "something went wrong."

<H3>CLASSPATH variable</H3>
Java supports an environment variable called CLASSPATH that tells the Java
virtual machine where to look for code. As a general rule, it is not a
good idea to set this variable. It is extremely difficult to set it correctly,
and if it is set incorrectly, it may prevent all Java programs from running.
The symptom is usually that you get a "class not found" error, although
this error is generated by Java for almost any kind of problem.

<P>Under Windows NT (4.0), open the Start menu (at the lower left), select
Settings and then Control Panel. Open the System control panel, and click
on the Environment tab. If the CLASSPATH variable is set, we suggest clearing
it (you may want to save its value, since it may be needed by some other
program). You then probably have to restart your browser.
