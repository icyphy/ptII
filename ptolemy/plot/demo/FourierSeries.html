<h1>Fourier Series Approximation to a Square Wave</h1>
<hr>
The plot below shows a sequence of approximations to a square
wave constructed by adding together sinusoids.
It is implemented by a Java class derived from Plot that
computes the data to be plotted on the fly:
<p>
<applet name="Fourier" code="pt.plot.demo.PlotFourierSeries"
    width=500 height=300
    codebase="../../.."
    archive="pt/plot/ptplotapplet.jar"
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."
>
<param name="background" value="faf0e6">
   <hr>If your browser recognized the applet tag,
    you would see an applet here.<hr>
</applet>
<p>
Note that you can zoom in on any region of the graph by drawing a box.
Start at the upper left corner of the region you wish to view in more
detail, and drag downwards and to the right.
Dragging upwards instead allows you to zoom out.  When zooming out,
a reference box is drawn that will represent the current view, and
dragging will cause a box to be displayed that represents the new
view.  Zooming out will only go as far as the original scale.
Clicking on the "fill" button at the upper right brings all data within range.
<p>
The <a href="PlotFourierSeries.java">source code</a>
defines a class <code>PlotFourierSeries</code>
derived from <code>Plot</code>.  This class contains a sequence of Java
statements in its <code>init()</code> method that configures and constructs
the plot.  This particular example also demonstrates a number of features.
In particular, no marks are made at all for each plotted point, so the plot
consists entirely of connected lines.
The X and Y ranges and tick marks are not given,
so they get computed automatically to just fit the data.
