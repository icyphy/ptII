<p>
Ptolemy II is a software framework developed as part of the Ptolemy project.
It is a Java-based component assembly framework with a graphical
user interface called Vergil.  Vergil itself is a component assembly
defined in Ptolemy II.
</p>
<p>
The Ptolemy project studies modeling, simulation, and design of
concurrent, real-time, embedded systems. The focus is on assembly of
concurrent components. The key underlying principle in the project is
the use of well-defined <i>models of computation</i> that govern the
interactions between components. A major problem area being addressed is
the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation.

The <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/index.html#in_browser">Ptolemy Project web page</a>
contains much more information about the
project. The work is conducted in the
<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/#in_browser">Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences</a>
of the
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/#in_browser">University of California at Berkeley</a>.
The project is directed by
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eal/index.html#in_browser">Prof. Edward Lee</a>.
The project is named after
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/people/ptolemy.htm#in_browser">Claudius Ptolemaeus</a>,
the second century Greek astronomer, mathematician, and geographer.

Ptolemy II includes a growing suite of <i>domains</i>, each of which
realizes a model of computation.  It also includes a component library,
in which most components are <i>domain polymorphic</i>, in that they
can operate in several of the domains.  Most are also <i>data polymorphic</i>,
in that they operate on several data types.
The domains that have been implemented are listed below.
Domains that are reasonably mature:
