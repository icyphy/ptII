<h2>StructuralCoder</h2>
"StructuralCoder is an engine that synthesizes controllers from formal specifications described under a subset of linear temporal logic (LTL). 

Importantly, it synthesizes synchronous dataflow controllers (in Lustre or in Ptolemy II form) and maintains requirement-to-code traceability. Such a feature is mandated in developing safety-critical systems and are considered essential for specification validation or integrating manual implementation such as legacy code. " StructuralCoder is
developed by <a href="http://www.fortiss.org/en/home/" target="_top">fortiss GmbH (An-Institut Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen)</a> and is released under GNU LGPLv3.&nbsp; See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/structuralcoder/#in_browser">http://sourceforge.net/projects/structuralcoder/</a>
