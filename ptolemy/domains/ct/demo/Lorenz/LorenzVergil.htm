<p>
This nonlinear feedback system is the well-known Lorenz attractor,
which exhibits chaotic behavior in the form of an
unstable periodic orbit.
The system is given by the differential equations:
<pre>
<code>    dx1/dt = sigma*(x2-x1)</code>
<code>    dx2/dt = (lambda-x3)*x1 -x2</code>
<code>    dx3/dt = x1*x2-b*x3</code>
</pre>
<p>
The applet above simulates these differential equations using
the CT (continuous-time) domain in Ptolemy II.  The CT domain
includes a sophisticated numerical solver for differential equations.
The plot shows x2 vs. x1. The initial conditions of the states are
all 1.0. The parameters sigma, lambda and b can be modified to change
the behavior of the model.
<p>
Above, the applet has been implemented directly in
Java (see the <a href="Lorenz.java">source code</a>).
An <a href="LorenzVergil.htm">alternative definition</a>
uses the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
