<p>This demo shows how to use the NonInterruptibleTimer actor and Pulse actor to
model an assembly line.

<p>The Clock actor (Jobs) generates a set of jobs at different times, where no two
jobs happen at the same time. The Pulse actor (ServiceTimes) takes a job 
request and produces the service time of the job request. </p>

<p>The NonInterruptibleTimer actor (Station) takes the service time and sets a
timer. The timer goes off when the service time expires. The timer can not
be interrupted to respond to another input when it is running. </p>

<p>A job is passed along all three stations. The Plotter monitors the outputs
from Stations plots the times when jobs leaves the station.</p>

<p>This model is based on the assembly line example described in "Distributed 
Discrete-Event Simulation" by Jayadev Misra, Computer Surveys, Vol. 18, 
No. 1, March 1986.</p>
