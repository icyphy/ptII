<h1>Vergil Acknowledgements</h1>
Many people have contributed to the current state of Vergil either by writing
code that Vergil is based on, or by giving their suggestions, or reporting
bugs, including:
Frederic Boulanger, John Davis, Frank Gruetzmacher, Christopher Hylands, Bart Keinhuis, Jie Liu, Sonia Sachs, Michael Shilman, Neil Smyth, Edward Lee, Xavier Warzee, Xiaojun Liu, Scott Weber, Ed Willink, and others I'm sure have been mistakenly left off of this list.
