<h1>DDE Domain</h1>
The Distributed Discrete Event (DDE) domain incorporates a distributed
notion of time into a dataflow style communication semantic. Much of
the functionality of the DDE domain is consistent with the Process
Networks domain. In particular, this model of computation's mechanism
for dealing with blocking due to empty or full queues is functionally
identical to that of the PN domain.
<P>
The DDE domain's use of time serves as the point of divergence in the
respective designs of DDE and PN. Time progress is communicated between
actors by passing tokens that have time stamps associated with them. In
a network of DDE actors each actor has a local notion of time. To
facilitate this local notion of time, actors in a DDE model adhere to 
the following constraints.

<UL>
	<LI> Successive tokens emitted from any actor's output port
	     must have a time stamp that is greater than or equal
	     to that of previous tokens.
	<LI> An actor can consume a token on an input port (P1) only
	     if the other input ports of that actor have pending
	     tokens with time stamps greater than or equal to that
	     of P1.
	<LI> If an actor has two or more input ports with pending
	     time stamps that are identical, then a local input 
	     port prioritization rule must be invoked to determine
	     the ordering of these <I>simultaneous</I> tokens.
</UL>

The above rules facilitate a local notion of time and are consistent
with the <I>conservative</I> blocking mechanism of Chandy and Misra's
distributed discrete event system.
<P>
We are approaching the DDE model of computation as the intersection
between dataflow and discrete event semantics. This allows us to 
study DDE semantics from two different perspectives. In particular,
we can benefit from denotational semantics that are based on metric
spaces (the Banach oriented DE approach) or posets (the Tarskian
oriented dataflow approach). Matthews offers a partial metric 
topology which incorporates both of these mathematical tools.
