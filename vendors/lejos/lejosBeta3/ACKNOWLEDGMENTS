Jose's comments (02/28/00):
---------------------------

- TinyVM is linked with Kekoa Proudfoot's rcx library
  from librcx.

- TinyVM sources include "rom.h" from Kekoa Proudfoot's
  librcx.

- Several files were copied from Kekoa's librcx, 
  and modified slightly.

- I've read Kekoa's RCX internals page, especially
  the ROM disassembly and the bytecode specification,
  without which I couldn't have written the code necessary
  to download binaries into the RCX.

- Dave Baum's email dated 29 Aug 1998, with subject
  "RE: Lego Mindstorms Page," describing the packet
  format, was very helpful in understanding how
  RCX communication works.

- An article that appeared in Dr. Dobb's Journal a
  few months ago by Markus Noga about legOS, is what
  led me to purchase the RIS and later to write
  this firmware replacement program. (The name TinyVM
  probably came from a comment about his tiny OS).
  Needless to say, I've read some of the legOS
  files.

- I'd like to thank anyone else who has played
  a part in figuring out RCX internals.

- SPECIAL THANKS to my wife, Erika, for putting up 
  with me during the development of this project.

After 0.1beta1:
---------------

- Thanks to Christophe Vanhecke, for lending TinyVM
  some webspace at his site: www.crazyrobots.com.

- Carlos Solorzano (my brother) helped me port
  TinyVM to JDK1.2 over the phone.
  
After leJOS fork, before first leJOS release:
---------------------------------------------

- Copied a lot of code from TinyVM, including Ryan
  VanderBijl's code. Refer to TinyVM acknowledgments 
  for 0.1.3 and up.

- Kekoa Proudfoot's librcx float library is now also linked.  
  
After 1.0.0alpha3:
------------------

- Brian Bagnall wrote the java.lang.Math class.

After 1.0.0alpha4:
------------------

- Brian Bagnall added the atan(double) method to Math.

After 1.0.0beta2:
-----------------

- Thanks to Christophe Ponsard for his example. Added also
  examples from TinyVM by Ryan Vander Bijl and Reinhard
  Schiedermeier.

- Copied the entire util/firmdl directory from legOS 0.2.4 
  in order to fix "Permission Denied" bug. Thanks to Paolo
  Masetti for his feedback regarding this problem.
