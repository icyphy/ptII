<H1>FurutaPendulum</H1>

The Furuta pendulum has a motor controlling the angle of an arm, from
which a free-swinging pendulum hangs.  The objective is to swing the
pendulum up and then balance it.

<h3>Execution</h3>
An execution of the model displays various signals and at the bottom produces a 3-D animation of the physical system. 

<br>Model by Johan Eker

<h3>Top-Level Model</h3> 


The top-level is a continuous-time model that specifies the dynamics
of the physical system as a set of nonlinear ordinary differential
equations, and encapsulates a closed loop controller.


Framework by Jie Liu


<h3>Higher-Order Components</h3>

Complex submodels are generated automatically from equations
describing the physical dynamics.


<br>Framework by Jie Liu

<h3>A Modal Controller</h3>

The controller itself is modal, with three modes of operation, where a
different control law is specified for each mode.


<br>Framework by Xiaojun Liu


<h3>The Discrete Controllers</h3>

Three discrete submodels (dataflow models) specify control laws for
each of three modes of operation.
<br>Framework by Steve Neuendorffer


<h3>The Graphical Animator</h3>

A 3-D graphical animation is constructed modularly as a parametric
scene graph that is driven by the physical model.
