	This package contains the automatically generated backtracking versions of
	Ptolemy actors. For each actor listed in <a
	href="source.lst">source.lst</a>, a backtracking version is generated and
	placed in the "ptolemy" sub-directory. These actors have the same
	functionality as the original ones, and their states can be rolled back with
	the checkpointing mechanism.

    @since Ptolemy II 6.1
