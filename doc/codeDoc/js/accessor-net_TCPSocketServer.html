    <div class="container-overview">
    
        
            <div class="description"><p>This accessor establishes a server that can accept connection requests for
 a TCP socket and can send and/or receives messages from the client that makes the
 request.</p>
<p> When the server is listening and accepting connections, the port on which it is
 listening is emitted on the <code>listening</code> output port.</p>
<p> When a connection is established, this accessor outputs on the <code>connection</code> output
 an object with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong>: A unique ID identifying the connection (a positive integer).</li>
<li><strong>remoteHost</strong>: The IP address of the remote host for the socket (a string).</li>
<li><strong>remotePort</strong>: The port of the remote host for the socket (an integer).</li>
<li><strong>status</strong>: The string 'open'.</li>
</ul>
<p> When the connection is closed, the same object as above is produced on the
 <code>connection</code> output, except with status being 'closed'.</p>
<p> When data is received from the connection, two outputs are produced.
 The data itself is produced on the <code>received</code> output.  The ID of the connection
 over which the data arrived is produced on the <code>receivedID</code> output.</p>
<p> To send data over a connection, provide the data on the <code>toSend</code> input port
 and the ID of the connection on the <code>toSendID</code> input port.  To send to all open
 connections, provide an ID of 0 (zero).</p>
<p> The send and receive types can be any of those supported by the host.
 The list of supported types will be provided as options for the <code>sendType</code>
 and <code>receiveType</code> parameter. For the Ptolemy II host, these include at
 least 'string', 'number', 'image', and a variety of numeric types.</p>
<p> If both ends of the socket are known to be JavaScript clients,
 then you should use the 'number' data type for numeric data.
 If one end or the other is not JavaScript, then
 you can use more specified types such as 'float' or 'int', if they
 are supported by the host. In all cases, received numeric
 data will be converted to JavaScript 'number' when emitted.
 For sent data, this will try to convert a JavaScript number
 to the specified type. The type 'number' is equivalent
 to 'double'.</p>
<p> When type conversions are needed, e.g. when you send a double
 with <code>sendType</code> set to int, or an int with <code>sendType</code> set to byte,
 then a &quot;primitive narrowing conversion&quot; will be applied, as specified here:
 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3 .</p>
<p> For numeric types, you can also send an array with a single call
 to this.send(). The elements of the array will be sent in sequence all
 at once, and may be received in one batch. If both ends have
 <code>rawBytes</code> set to false (specifying message framing), then these
 elements will be emitted at the receiving end all at once in a single
 array. Otherwise, they will be emitted one at a time.</p>
<p> For strings, you can also send an array of strings in a single call,
 but these will be simply be concatenated and received as a single string.</p>
<p> If the <code>rawBytes</code> option is set to false, then each data item that arrives on
 <code>toSend</code>, of any type or array of types, will be coalesced into a single message and
 the receiving end (if it also has <code>rawBytes</code> set to false) will emit the entire
 message, and only the message, exactly once.  Otherwise, a message may get
 fragmented, emitted in pieces, or coalesced with subsequent messages.</p>
<p> When a model with an instance of this accessor stops executing, there
 are two mechanisms by which data in transit can be lost. In both cases, warning
 messages or error messages will be issued to the host to be displayed or otherwise
 handled as the host sees fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, there might be queued messages that were received on <code>toSend</code> but have not yet
been sent, either because the socket has not yet been opened or because
it was closed from the other side.</li>
<li>Second, a message might be received from the server after shutdown has commenced.
In particular, received messages are handled asynchronously by a handler function
that can be invoked at any time, and that handler might be invoked after it is no
longer possible for this accessor to produce outputs (it has entered its wrapup
phase of execution).</li>
</ul>
<p> The client might similarly lose messages by the same two mechanisms occurring
 on the client side. In that case, messages will presumably be displayed on the
 client side.</p>
<p> Accessors that extend this one can override the <code>toSendInputHandler</code> function
 to customize what is sent.</p>
<p> This accessor requires the 'socket' module.</p></div>

 specifying the options, setting up listeners to be notified when the server is
 is listening for connections, when a client requests and connection,
 and when errors occur, and setting up an input handler
 for data arriving on the toSend input. When a client requests a connection, the
 handler will open the socket, send a <code>connection</code> output, and and set up listeners
 for incoming data, errors, and closing of the socket from the remote site.</p>
