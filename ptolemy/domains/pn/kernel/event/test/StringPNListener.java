/**
 A PNProcessListener that listens for events generated by
 PNDirector and converts it to a string.
 An StringPNListener is able to receive PNProcessEvents that are issued
 during the execution of a process by a ProcessThread or director in PN.
 <p>When getProfile() is called, the internal buffer is returned
 and the internal buffer is reset.
