<h2>Major Features that are new in Ptolemy 3.0 </h2>
<menu>

<li> Continuous Time (CT) domain rework for improved mixed signal and
hybrid systems semantics
(Jie Liu, Parc, and Haiyang Zheng).

<li> <a href="../ptolemy/domains/ci/doc/body.htm" target="body">Component Interaction Domain</a>
(Yang Zhao, Xiaojun Liu) - The CI domain models systems that contain
both data-driven and demand-driven styles of computation.

<li> Rework of FSM domain to support chained transitions
and better hybrid systems semantics (Haiyang Zheng).

<li> Expression language rework to create a full-featured, functional
and higher-order expression language with extensive support for
composite types such as matrices, arrays, and records;
the expression language is also now fully integrated with the Ptolemy II
type system
 (Steve Neuendorffer, Edward A. Lee).

<li> Configurations have been reworked to make it much easier to
create standalone tools that extract portions of the Ptolemy II
infrastructure and have customized user interfaces, documentation,
and actor and director libraries.
Configurations have been refactored into
separate directories in <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/configs</CODE>,
and one example of such a standalone tool, HyVisual, is provided.

<li> Updates to Vergil, the user interface for building models
(Steve Neuendorffer, Edward A. Lee, John Reekie):
	<menu>
	<li> Run buttons on the toolbar and hotkeys.
        <li> Persistent window sizing and placement.
	<li> Undo/Redo.
	<li> Port Parameters.
	<li><CODE>vergil -help</CODE> lists available configurations.
	<li> Full-screen mode for use in presentations.
        </menu>

<li> Other user interface improvements
(Steve Neuendorffer, Edward A. Lee):
        <menu>
        <li> Interactive shells infrastructure.
        <li> An interactive expression shell using this infrastructure.
	<li> Infrastructure for specialized token viewers.
        Files with the extension .ptd are now opened by a token viewer.
        The default token viewers is a text editor, but others can be
	added in the configuration.
	<li> A matrix token viewer.
        </menu>

<li> HSIF Support
(Haiyang Zheng).
The Hybrid System Interchange Format (HSIF), was developed by the
<a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu#in_browser">
Institute of Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) at Vanderbilt University</a>
as part of the
<a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/mobies/default.html#in_browser">ISIS MoBIES</a> effort.
The HSIF documentation states:
<menu>
"The goal of HSIF is to define an interchange format for hybrid system
models that can be shared between modeling and analysis tools. HSIF
models represent dynamic systems, whose dynamics includes both
continuous and discrete behaviors."
</menu>
Haiyang Zheng developed a set of XSLT files that convert
HSIF into MoML, the XML format used to represent Ptolemy II Models.
See the <a href="../ptolemy/hsif/demo/index.htm">HSIF/MoML documentation</a>.
</li>

<li> A first version of higher-order components, the
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/hoc/MultiInstanceComposite.html">
MultiInstanceComposite</a> actor
(Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, Research In Motion, Ltd.).
This actor creates a parameterized number of instances of a composite
actor.

<li>
Python integration, with a
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/python/PythonScript.java">PythonScript</a>
actor that permits definition of actors in Python (Xiaojun Liu).
This uses
<a href="http://www.jython.org/#in_browser" target="_top">Jython</a>,
a Java implementation of Python.
</menu>
<h2>Other Features that are new in Ptolemy II 3.0</h2>

<ul>

<li> Ptolemy II Matlab interface updates
(Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, Research In Motion, Ltd.):
<menu>
<li> Logical variable support for Matlab version 6.5 (R13).
<li> Remove (the need for) ptmatlab.dll being in the user's path.
<li> Removed warnings for gcc version 3.2 (used by latest cygwins).
<li> Add support/configuration for building on Linux.

 <li> <a href="../ptolemy/matlab/demo/MatlabCT/MatlabCT.xml">
Matlab Continuous Time Demonstration</a>
</menu>
These demos require that Matlab be installed locally; they will not work
within an applet, but will work with Web Start.

<li> <a href="http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/caltrop/index.html#in_browser" target="_top">Cal Actor Language (CAL)</a>
(J&ouml;rn W. Janneck, Chris Chang, Johan Ecker,
John Reekie, Yang Zhao, Ed Willink, Lars Wernli):

<br>The CAL actor language is a textual notation for representing the
functionality of dataflow actors. It is designed to allow low-entropy
descriptions of actors by providing statically analyzable information
about the behavior of an actor, such as the number of tokens it
produces and consumes in each firing, whether there are any conditions
on being able to fire, what those conditions depend on, etc.

<a href="../ptolemy/cal/demo/SDFDDI/SDFDDI.xml">SDFDDI</a>.

<li> <a href="codegen.htm">Code generator improvements</a>
(Steve Neuendorffer, Christopher Hylands):
The Java code generator now handles Expression actors.
The code generator now works with Java 1.4.
The applet generator has been extended to copy necessary jar
files on an as needed basis.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/FunctionToken.html">FunctionToken</a>
class (Xiaojun Liu, Steve Neuendorffer): An expression that defines a function
can be passed among actors in a function token.

<li> Transition Refinements: A transition in an FSM can have
a refinement, which is a model that executes when the refinement
is taken.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/kernel/attributes/FileAttribute.html">
FileAttribute</a> class
(Edward A. Lee).
This attribute makes it easy to create a parameter in an actor
that represents a file or resource. It supports specification
of files using paths relative to the model, the classpath, or
the user directory.  It also provides a convenient user interface for
selecting and accessing files on the file system.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/ImageToken.html">ImageToken</a> class
(James Yeh): An abstract token that contains images.  Derived tokens
such as 
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/AWTImageToken.html">
AWTImageToken</a>,
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/jai/JAIImageToken.html">
ptolemy.actor.lib.jai.JAIImageToken</a>
provide concrete classes.

<li> Interface to C actors using the Java Native Interface
(Vincent Arnould, Thales, contributor: Christopher Hylands):
The <a href="codeDoc/jni/package-summary.htm">jni</a>
package contains a prototype of an interface between Ptolemy II actors
and C code by using the Java Native Interface (JNI).
To use this facility, you must download and install Ptolemy II 
from source.

<li>HSIF Thermostat and Swimming Pool
<br> This example shows a simple thermostat modeled as a hybrid system.
The purpose of the example is to demonstrate the ability that HyVisual has
to import models defined in HSIF, the <i>Hybrid System Interchange Format</i>.
To run HSIF models, you must invoke Ptolemy II with the <CODE>-hyvisual</CODE>
command line argument or else run the HyVisual Web Edition.  These
models will not work in a standard Ptolemy II vergil or Web Edition
because to support HSIF, we need to check xml each file to see
if it is an HSIF file of a MoML file.  This check slows Ptolemy II
down slightly.

<h2>Major Features that are new in Ptolemy 2.0 </h2>
<menu>

<li> <a href="../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/ModalModel/ModalModel.htm">Modal Models</a>
 (Xiaojun Liu, Edward A. Lee)
<br>A model model is one whose behavior depends on its "mode"
of operation. A modal model in Ptolemy II is an FSM (finite state machine)
combined hierarchically with other models. A state in the FSM represents
a mode of operation, and can have a refinement that gives the behavior
in that model.
The refinement can be another FSM or some other model using some other
Ptolemy domain. This example combines DE, FSM, and SDF to model a
system where regularly sampled signals are perturbed by irregular
events in time.
</li>

<li> <a href="codegen.htm">Code Generation</a>
(Primary Author: Stephen Neuendorffer, Contributor: Christopher Hylands)
 <br>This release includes a limited prototype of our code generation facility
that will generate .class files for non-hierarchical SDF models.

 <br>Note that the code generator will not work in an applet, but will
work with Web Start, the Windows installer and the standard configure
and build.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/unit/package-summary.html">ptolemy.data.unit</a> -
<a href="../ptolemy/data/unit/demo/Units/Units.htm">Units Demo</a>
(Primary Authors: Yuhong Xiong, Xiaojun Liu, Contributors: Winthrop Williams, Edward A. Lee)
<br>
A major source of errors in embedded software is incorrect application
of units. Yuhong Xiong and Xiaojun Liu have created a unit system for
Ptolemy II that is quite clever. A suite of constants are defined, with
names such as "meter", "cm", "feet", "miles", "seconds", "hours", and
"days". In each unit category ("length" or "time" for example), there
is a primary unit with respect to which all the others are specified.
Thus, for example, if the primary unit of length is meters, then the
expression "1.0 * cm" will have an internal value of 0.01 * meters.
Compound units are specified by just multiplying and dividing, as in
for example "1.0 * cm/second".

<p>The way this is realized is that these unit constants are tokens just
like other Ptolemy II data, and multiplication and division are
overloaded in the base classes for numeric valued tokens.  We continue
to work on this architecture to enable users to customize the unit
system on a per-model basis.

<li> <a href="../ptolemy/domains/tm/doc/body.htm" target="body">Timed Multitasking Domain</a>
(Jie Liu) - an implementation of a model of
computation based on priority-driven multitasking, as common in
