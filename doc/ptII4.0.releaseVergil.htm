<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a>
</h2>
Version 3.0.2 has the following limitations:

<h3>Release Limitations</h3>
<ul>

<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from 
ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu.
 <p>Note further that some of the .class names are longer than
31 characters, which may cause problems when downloading zip files
on the Macintosh and using Stuffit.

<li> The documentation for custom actors used in demonstrations is not
included in the release.  The source code for the custom actors can be found
in the source download.

<li> If a URL ends with <CODE>#in_browser</CODE>, then
Ptolemy II will invoke the User's web browser.  Unfortunately, this
does not always work, especially under Windows if Netscape is already
running.  The workaround is to exit Netscape and let Ptolemy II
start up Netscape for you.


<li> Web Start does not work very well if the pathname to the 
<CODE>vergil.jnlp</CODE> file has spaces in it.  The workaround is
to place your Ptolemy II tree in a directory that does not have spaces
in the path name if you plan on using Web Start.

<li> If your user library contains actors that are not present in
vergil, then you may see a dialog or dialogs asking if you want
to skip these elements.  This could happen if you had developed custom
actors and put them into your user library and these custom actors
are not present in the release.  The work around is to click 'Skip Element'
and continue with the start up.


<li> Ptolemy II has various problems under Mac OS X.  For details,
see <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII3.0/mac.htm#in_browser"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII3.0/mac.htm</CODE></a>.

<li> Applet issues:
	<ul>

	<li> We've experienced problems with the browser freezing
	when between applets.  What happens is that the previous
	applet gets a InterruptedException and pops up a modal dialog
	box, which freezed the browser.  We are working on a solution.

	<li> The Ptolemy II Applets require java 1.4.1_02 so as to prevent
	problems with Windows XP and Radeon displays that causes XP
	to hang when a Java application is exiting.  For details, see

<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4713003.html#in_browser" target="_top"><CODE>http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4713003.html</CODE></a>
	 <br>For non-applet situations, we can invoke the browser with
	<CODE>-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false</CODE> or 
	<CODE>-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true</CODE>, but for applets we must
	require Java 1.4.1_02 or later.  
	 <br>As a result, the applet html code requires version 1.4.1_02,
	so if you have 1.4.2 installed, you may need to reinstall the
	1.4.1_02 JRE for the applets to work.

	<li>Applets seem to run out of memory after about 82Mb.

	<li>There are no Jython or Cal applets 

	<li> Opera has problems viewing applets that are on the local
	file system.  In particular, it seems to have problems with urls like
	<CODE>file:///d|/ptII/ptolemy/plot/demo/FourierSeries.htm</CODE>
	which work fine in Netscape 4.x, IE, Mozilla.

	 <p>However, if I use the following style of URL, then some of the applets
	work: 
<CODE>file://localhost/d:/ptII/ptolemy/plot/demo/FourierSeries.htm</CODE>.
	Unfortunately any applet that accesses a data file will
	not work with the above URL style because the data file will
	be outside the codebase.

	 <p> The solution is to install a web server on the local
	machine and view the applets using 
	<CODE>http://localhost/</CODE>
	
        <li> Opera 6.03/Windows 2000/Java 1.4.0, may have
        problems running applets that include diva.jar if diva.jar
	is not downloaded in the first applet.  To reproduce this problem:
	<ol>
	<li> Run <a href="../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Butterfly/Butterfly.htm">SDF Butterfly</a>, which does not use diva.jar

	<li> <a href="../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Expression/Expression.htm">SDF Expression</a>, which uses diva.jar

	<li> In Opera, do <CODE>Window</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Special</CODE>
	-&gt; <CODE>Java Console</CODE>, and you will see the following
        stack trace
<pre>
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: diva/graph/GraphController

</pre>

	</ol>
	The problem only occurs under Opera.

	<li> Running the Networked demo via an applet on the local
	file system results in an AccessControlException.
<pre>
com.microstar.xml.XmlException: XML element "entity" triggers exception:
  java.lang.Exception: Attempted to lookup 'Waveform', but got: 
  java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Waveform
Attempted to find as a moml class, but got:

	at ptolemy.actor.gui.MoMLApplet._createModel(MoMLApplet.java:188)
</pre>

	The Network demo does not work as a local applet because the xml file
	includes a reference to http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu, which is
	not on the local file system, so we get a SecurityException.
	 <br>The workaround is to run the applet by downloading it
	from the Ptolemy Website:
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII3.0/ptII3.0.2/ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/Networked.htm"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII3.0/ptII3.0.2/ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/Networked.htm</CODE></a>
	</ul>

<li> Windows Installer Issues:
 	<ul>

	<li> The Interface to C actors using the Java Native Interface
	is not available via the Windows Installer (or Web Start).
	To use the JNI/Ptolemy II interface, you must download 
	Ptolemy II as source files and compile.

	<li> Sometimes running a model that uses the Matlab interface
	will cause Ptolemy II to exit.  Usually this occurs if Vergil
	has been running for a while and then the Matlab interface is loaded.
	<br><b>Workaround #1</b>: Run a model that uses the Matlab interface
	as the first model by doing Quick Tour -&gt; Matlab CT.
	<br><b>Workaround #2</b>:
        We believe that the problem has to do with loading the Direct
	Draw library.
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4838939.html#in_browser" target="_top"><code>http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4838939.html</code></a>
        suggests invoking java with <code>-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true</code>.
	<br>The way to do this is to edit <code>vergil-full.<b>lax</b></code>
	and add the line
	<pre>
lax.nl.java.option.additional=-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true	
</pre>
        which we went ahead and did.  Note that because of problems
	with Radeon displays, setting noddraw to true is not such
	a bad idea.  See above for details.
        <br>The way to check if this argument is being used is to
	hold down the Control key and double click on the
	<code>vergil-full.<b>exe</b></code> icon.
	<br>You should see something like:
	<pre>	
c:\j2sdk1.4.2\bin\java.exe -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true com.zerog.lax.LAX C:\\Ptol
emy\\Ptolemy_II_3.0.2ptiny\\vergil-ptiny.lax C:\\DOCUME~1\\cxh\\LOCALS~1\\Temp
\\env.prop
executing java...
        </pre>
	Note that to debug the binary, you would use the following line:
        <pre>
lax.nl.java.option.additional=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_shmem,server=y,suspend=n 
        </pre>

	<li> The Windows task bar shows a 'Launch Anywhere' icon instead
	of a Vergil Icon.

	</ul>

<li> Web Start issues:
	<ul>
	<li> The Python Ptolemizer demo does not work under Web Start,
	probably because Jython cannot handle loading classes
	from the Ptolemy II classes. 
	<li> Viewing a pdf file may bring up a blank window along with
	the pdf file.  Running the code generator may bring up
	a blank window while the java or javac processes are running.

	<li> Some of the links on the GR domain instructions page
	might not work under Web Start because the files they refer
	to are not present. 
        </ul>

<li> Limitations in demonstrations
        <ul>

	<li> CT CarTracking should be run using View-&gt;Run
	so that the user can change the fault parameter.

        <li> HTVQ demo: The displays do not go away when
	the demo is exited.

        <li> GR demos: The ViewScreen actor does not go away when
	the demo is exited.


	<li> GR demos: Under Java 3D 1.3.1-beta, the ViewScreen
	actor may display a black image when a second GR demo is run.
	 <br>The workaround is to install Java 3D 1.2.1_04.

        <li> Bouncer demo: If the user drags the bouncing icon, it no
	longer bounces
	<li> TM Merged Events: Clicking on the 'Plot Schedule' icon
	brings up a plot, but the plot remains empty, the schedule
	never appears
        </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations in the Actor Libraries</h3>
<ul>
<li>The actor library is far from complete.
<li>The Expression actor does not properly propagate type constraints in
an expression-dependent fashion. It works correctly for double-valued
expressions of double-valued inputs.

<li> The Ptolemy parameter parser uses comma "," to separate elements
in an array.  This causes problems when Ptolemy is run on
European machines that use a comma "1,0" instead of a period "1.1"
in floating point numbers.

<li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.

<!-- If you change the next paragraph update install.htm -->

<li>The Matlab interface works only under Windows and it requires that
Matlab be installed on the local machine. 
The Matlab interface should work with version of Matlab from
R11 (5.3) and up to and including R13 (6.5)
<p>Didier Mauuary reports that under Windows 98, configure failed
to set up the <code>MATLAB_DIR</code>, <code>PTCC</code>
and <code>PTDLLTOOL</code> makefile variables, but after
he set them by hand:
<pre>
 MATLAB_DIR = /cygdrive/c/MATLABR11
 PTCC = gcc
 PTDLLTOOL = dlltool
</pre>
he was able to get farther with the recompilation of the Matlab interface.

<li> The actor.lib.comm.SerialComm actor requires that Javacomm is installed

<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html#in_browser" target="_top"><CODE>http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html</CODE></a>.
The SerialComm actor will only work under Windows.

</ul>

<h3>Limitations in the PN Domain</h3>
The PN domain documents that it locally handles mutations.  However, this
is currently not true in the implementation.  For the basic PN model, this
doesn't really matter, since mutations happen pretty much the same as they
would otherwise.  (i.e. they are non-deterministic in when they execute) 
However, for timed PN models, there is actually some expressiveness
lost, since timed PN models can locally execute mutations deterministically.


<h3>Limitations in the User Interface</h3>

Below are some of the limitations of Vergil, the Ptolemy II Graphical
User Interface.

<ul>

<li> If there are multiple windows open for a model, say, the top
level vergil window and the tree view, or the top level window
and the inside look of a composite component, when the top
level window is closed, all other windows are closed, but the
user is not prompted to save any change to the model.

<li> When setting the type of a port, we should provide a combo
box that lists the common ports

<li> When creating a Modal Model, use Control-Right-Button to
drawn arcs between nodes.  One potential workaround would
be to have an information message in the status bar about this.

<li> You should not change the names of built in ports - The port
mechanism should disallow port name changes on ports that are
named in Java.  The UI could recognize this.  The UI should
not allow the user to remove built in Java defined ports.

<li> Manually setting of the types of actors like ArrayToSequence that
have constraints on their element types can cause problems.
<li> HTVQ demo is badly laid out when run under vergil.
<li>Weak support for multiports in the graph editor.
<li>It is difficult to control wire routing.
<li>Cannot have more than one vertex in a connection.
<li>No mechanism to set the width of a relation.
<li>The integrated web browser is not a full-featured browser.
<li>Icon editor not yet integrated.
<li>Debugger not yet integrated.
<li>It is difficult to add actors to the libraries.
<li>No dynamic class reloading.
</ul>

<h3>Code Generation Limitations</h3>
Code Generation limitations are covered on the
<a href="codegen.htm#limitations">Code Generation</a> page. 

<h3>Missing Domains</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boolean and integer dataflow.
<li>Dynamic dataflow
</ul>
