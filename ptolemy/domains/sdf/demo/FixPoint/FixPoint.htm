<H1>Fixed-point conversion and overflow demo</H1>

<P>The follow plot shows the numbers generated by a Ramp actor (i.e.,
the blue line), which generates a stream of double tokens with a 0.1
increment starting from -1.0.  The double tokens are converted into
fix-points tokens with the given precision (i.e., the red line).

<P>In the demo, the precision of the fix-point is set equal to
<I>(2.1)</I>. This means that three bits are used to represent
a number with two bits representing the integer part and one bit
representing the fractional part (The same precision can also be
written as either <I>(3/2)</I> or <I>(2^3)</I>). Thus, the set of
numbers that can be represented with a (2.1) precision is:

<PRE>
{ -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 }
</PRE>

<P>Consequently, the stream of tokens produced by the ramp need to be mapped on this set of numbers, causing finite-precision quantization errors.  In mapping the numbers of the ramp into the set of fix-point numbers, there are two modes available: <B>Rounding</B> and <B>Truncate</B>.
