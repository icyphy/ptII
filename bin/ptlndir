# ptlndir - create shadow link tree
# ptlndir creates a shadow link tree.  ptlndir is different from
# lndir in that it handles SCCS directories, and won't create subdirectories
# for directories named 'junk' or 'adm'
#
# $Id$

# ptlndir is based on lndir:

# Used to create a copy of the a directory tree that has links for all non-
# directories (except those named RCS).  If you are building the distribution
# on more than one machine, you should use this script.
#
# If your master sources are located in /usr/local/src/X and you would like
# your link tree to be in /usr/local/src/new-X, do the following:
#
# 	%  mkdir /usr/local/src/new-X
#	%  cd /usr/local/src/new-X
# 	%  ptlndir ../X
#
# Note: does not link files beginning with "."  Is this a bug or a feature?
#
# Improvements over R3 version:
#   Allows the fromdir to be relative: usually you want to say "../dist"
#   The name is relative to the todir, not the current directory.
#
# Bugs in R3 version fixed:
#   Do "pwd" command *after* "cd $DIRTO".
#   Don't try to link directories, avoiding error message "<dir> exists".
#   Barf with Usage message if either DIRFROM *or* DIRTO is not a directory.
