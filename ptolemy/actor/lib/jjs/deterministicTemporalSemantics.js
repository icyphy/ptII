/** The is the implementation of another deterministic temporal semantics.
 * 
 *  This module provides Accessors with deterministic temporal semantics, 
 *  that are aligned with Cape Code's semantics. This module is to be explored 
 *  by commonHost, so that any swarmlet host will enjoy these features.
 *  For this, accessors calls to setTimeout() or setInterval() are binded, 
 *  respectively, to this module's setTioumetDet() and setIntervalDet(). It is 
 *  guaranteed that only one timeout (function provided by the host) is pending  
 *  at any time and that callbacks will be executing with respect to their  
 *  logical clock domains and their relative priority and/or arrival time.
 *  
 *  For this implementation, we assume that there is the physical time line, 
 *  together with many logical time lines. All time lines do not advance the same 
 *  way. Physical time is continuous and has the same rate, while logical time is 
 *  updated at particular instances.
 *  
 *  Each logical time line is associated with a 'labeled logical clock domains'
 *  (LLCD). This allows for defining and implementing logical simultaneity of 
 *  callbacks execution. 
 *
 *  The basic idea is to define each delayed callback with an LLCD. Two delayed 
 *  callbacks with the same LLCD share the same logical time line. If they have
 *  the same logical time execution, then they will execute atomically one after 
 *  another, such that their arrival order is respected. That is, if the instruction
 *  setInterval(F, T, 'A') was called before setInterval(G, T, 'A'), and no other
 *  action involving the LLCD 'A' has happened in between, then when F executes, it 
 *  will be immediately followed by G.  
 *  
 *  When a call to the binded setTimeout or setInterval occur, then scheduling the 
 *  execution will depend on the LLCD. If it is a new one, then a new LLCD is created
 *  and its current logical time is set to the current physical time. However, if the 
 *  LLCD is already defined, then the current logical time of that clock domain is 
 *  used. In either cases, the callback will execute at its LLCD logical current time 
 *  plus the timeout.
 *
 *  This implementation was preceded by a another one that adopts a slightly different
 *  semantics for the execution. In the previous version, any two callbacks with the 
 *  same label execute starting from the same reference point in time. In addition,
 *  there are only two time lines: the physical one and the logical one. Therefore,
 *  delayed callbacks execute only with respect to the logical one. This way, the inter
 *  execution time is always respected. The drawback is that additional delays are 
 *  added.
 *  
 *  For the purpose of these new temporal semantics, we record all delayed callBacks
 *  in the 'delayedCallbacks' object. This object is accessed by label. Within a 
 *  labeled object, we record the current logical execution  time, and the group of 
 *  delayed callbacks having the same label. A new delayedCallback object is added 
 *  to delayedCallbacks, given its label. In addition, each new object is uniquely 
 *  identified by a number (generated by automatically incrementing cbIdentifier). 
 *  Consequently, the identifier reflects the order in which the calls to setTimeout 
 *  or setInterval occurred. This number is returned and is to be used for clearing 
 *  the corresponding timer. This happens each time setTimeoutDet() or seIntervalDet() 
 *  is called. 
 *  
 *  For the sake of any system that may need to define execution order based on 
 *  predefined/precomputed priorities, it is possible to pass the priority 
 *  as an argument to setTimeout or setInterval. Consequently, the third level of
 *  delayed callbacks ordering will be, first, based on priorities, then on arrival
 *  time (reflected by the identifiers). For the case of Accessors, the priority will
 *  be inherited from the accessor's priority (if defined).
 *  
 *  If the programmer unintentionally or intentionally do not provide a synchronization
 *  label, then a new unique one will be generated automatically. This means that 
 *  each call to setTimeout or setInterval, that is done without specifying the label,
 *  will be considered as a new one, and it will be unique (by incrementing 
 *  defaultLabelIndex).
 *  
 *  In order to make the process fast, the list 'callbackQueue' keeps an incremental 
 *  next execution time sorted list of pointers to the delayed callbacks. Pointers
 *  are objects with two attributes: the labeled clock domain and the identifier.
 *  This list, has three levels of sorting. The first one is obviously the execution
 *  time. If two or more callbacks have the same execution time, they are ordered by 
 *  their labels origin. This is the second level of sorting. Finally, the third one is 
 *  the callbacks ordering, reflected by the identifiers. 
 *  
 *  A delayed callback declares the following attributes: 
 *   *  callbackFunction: the callback function
 *   *  interval: that is the triggering timeout
 *   *  periodic: if set to true, the callback needs to execute every interval time,
 *      otherwise, it executes only once.
 *   *  nextExecutionTime: records the next time at which the callback should be
 *      executed.
 *   *  priority: that is an optional attribute, that can be passed during the delayed
 *      callback creation.
 *   *  errorCallback: another optional attribute that specifies the callback to execute 
 *      in case the callbackFunction execution failed.
 *   *  cleanCallback: again, another optional attribute that gives the callback function
 *      to execute after successfully executing the callback function. For the particular 
 *      case of Accessors, the need is to clean the accessor's timers attribute.
 *        
 *  Proof: Done! Using Real-Time Maude :-)
