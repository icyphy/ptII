    <div class="container-overview">
    
        
            <div class="description"><p>This module provides host-independent functions for swarmlet hosts.
 A specific host (such as the Node.js host, the browser host, or the Ptolemy II
 host) can use this module to implement common functionality that is realizable
 in pure JavaScript.</p>
<h2> Instantiating Accessors</h2><p> Specifically, this module provides a constructor for instantiating accessors,
 and a convenience function (<strong>instantiateAccessor</strong>) that takes as an argument
 the fully qualified accessor class name, such as 'net/REST'.</p>
<p> For these functions to be able to instantiate an accessor given only its class name,
 the host needs to provide as an argument to new Accessor() or
 instantiateAccessor() a function, here designated getAccessorCode(), that
 will retrieve the accessor source code given the class name. This cannot be done
 in a host-independent way. For example, <code>getAccessorCode('net/REST')</code>
 should return the JavaScript  code defining the REST accessor.
 This function must also be provided if the host is to support accessor
 subclassing (extend()) or interface implementation (implement()).</p>
<p> The constructor and instantiate functions return an object that is an instance of an
 accessor. A specific host will typically use this by invoking the following
 instance's functions, perhaps in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>setParameter</strong>(name, value): Set a parameter value.</li>
<li><strong>initialize</strong>(): Initialize the accessor.</li>
<li><strong>provideInput</strong>(name, value): Provide an input value.</li>
<li><strong>react()</strong> React to input values and fire the accessor.</li>
<li><strong>latestOutput</strong>(name): Retrieve an output value produced in react().</li>
<li><strong>wrapup</strong>(): Wrap up the accessor.</li>
</ul>
<p> The react() function first invokes all input handlers that have been registered
 to handle provided inputs. It then invokes all input handlers that have been
 registered to handle any input.  Finally, it invokes the fire() function of the
 accessor, if one is defined.</p>
<h2> Events Emitted</h2><p> An instantiated accessor is an event emitter that emits the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>initialize</strong>: Emitted when the accessor has been initialized.</li>
<li><strong>output</strong>(<em>name</em>, <em>value</em>): Emitted when an output with the specified name
and value are sent.</li>
<li><strong>reactStart</strong> Emitted when a reaction is starting.</li>
<li><strong>reactEnd</strong>: Emitted when the accessor has reacted.</li>
<li><strong>wrapup</strong>: Emitted when the accessor has wrapped up.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Extend and Implement</h2><p> If a getAccessorCode() function is provided, then this implementation supports
 the <strong>extend</strong>() and <strong>implement</strong>() functions. An accessor A extends an accessor
 B if it includes in its setup() function a statement like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code> this.extend(B);</code></pre><p> In this case, there will be two accessor instances created, one for A and one for
 B. Somewhat confusingly, A will be the prototype of B. This may seem backwards,
 but there is a good reason for it. B omits several key properties, such as its
 lists of inputs, outputs, and parameters. And thus, when the setup() function of
 B creates an input, that input becomes an input of A.  Accessor A can reference
 the instance of B as A.ssuper.  The exported functions of B are accessible via
 as A.ssuper.exports or A.exports.ssuper.</p>
<p> Accessor A <strong>implements</strong> accessor B if its setup function includes:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code> this.implement(B);</code></pre><p> This case is similar, in that A becomes the prototype of B, but the instance of
 B is not available to A. The only interaction between the two is that when the
 setup() function of B is invoked, it will again create inputs, outputs, and
 parameters in A rather than in its own instance.</p>
<p> If A extends B, then the exports property of B becomes the prototype of the
 exports property of A.  This is the reverse of the prototype chain for the
 accessor instance itself. The reason for this is that B may define 'base-class'
 functions and properties that may or may not be overridden by A. These should
 be declared as exported properties.  For example, if B has a property:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code> exports.foo = 10;</code></pre><p> Then A can refer to foo as <code>exports.foo</code>. A can also override the value of
 foo by just writing to it.</p>
<h2> Composite Accessors</h2><p> If a getAccessorCode() function is provided, then this implementation supports
 composite accessors, which can instantiate other accessors (instantiate()) and
 connect them (connect()).  That is, an accessor may be defined as a hierarchical
 composition of other accessors.</p>
<p> If C is a composite accessor and you invoke C.provideInput(name, value) to
 provide an input to C, the same input will be automatically provided to any
 contained accessor that is connected to the input with the specified name.</p>
<p> Moreover, if C does not provide its own fire() function, then a default fire()
 function will invoke react() on any contained accessors that are provided with
 an input. If those contained accessors produce outputs, those will be provided
 as inputs to any connected accessors and then those will react as well.
 Finally, a contained accessor may send an output to an output of C, in which
 case the composite accessor will produce an output.</p>
<p> The reactions of contained accessors in a composite will occur in topological
 sort order (upstream accessors are assured of reacting first). This ensures that
 reactions of a composite are deterministic. Specifically, suppose that A, B, and
 D are all accessors contained by a composite C. Suppose that the output of A goes
 to both B and D, and that the output of B also goes to D. Then B will always react
 before D, since it is upstream of D.</p>
<p> A composition of accessors can have cycles, but at least one output in any
 directed cycle must have the option 'spontaneous' set to 'true'. This means that
 the output is not immediately produced as a reaction to an input, but rather will
 be produced some time later as a consequence of a callback. If there is no such
 marked output, then the cycle is a causality loop. There is no way to determine
 the order in which accessors should react.</p>
<h2> Mutable Accessors</h2><p> Mutable accessors are a particular type of composite accessors. They have the ability
 to dynamically change their behavior by substituting a contained accessor X by another
 accessor X'. The Mutable accessor can be used as a placeholder where a designer can
 plug in a discovered accessor. In this version, reification mechanism is quit open,
 assuming that the correctness is checked by third party (such as a Broker accessor...).
 Nevertheless, reification condition, in the sense of interface refinement, as pointed 
 out in 'Introduction to Embedded Systems' textbook (by Lee &amp; Seshia) can be called as
 a commomHost function, that is isReifyableBy(). </p>
<p> When calling 'reify' function on a particular accessor X, the Mutable Accessor
 will connect to X, making it equivalent to X itself. This is enabled by the composition
 mechanism. And this is done on runtime. If there is a previous reified accessor, it is
 unreified.</p>
<p> The choice of the accessor to be used for reification can be handled by another accessor
 or actor. </p>
<p> At any time, a previous reification can be removed. This will make the Mutable Accessor
 equivalent to an interface again. Consequently, another reification may be performed,
 enabling thus dynamic substitution.</p>
<h2> Spontaneous Accessors</h2><p> An accessor need not have any inputs. In this case, an invocation of react()
 will not invoke any input handlers (there cannot be any) and will only invoke the
 fire() function.  Even with no fire() function, such an accessor can produce outputs
 if it sets up callbacks in its initialize() function, for example using
 setTimeout() or setInterval(). We call such an accessor a <strong>spontaneous accessor</strong>,
 because it spontaneously produces outputs without being triggered by any input.</p>
<p> A composite accessor can contain spontaneous accessors. When these produce outputs,
 the composite accessor will automatically react. Hence, the contained spontaneous
 accessor can trigger reactions of other contained accessors.</p>
<h2> Overriding Function Bindings</h2><p> A particular accessor host (such as the browser host or Node.js host) can
 provide an accessor instance with specific implementations of various functions
 that the accessor invokes. Such custom function
 bindings will override the defaults in this implementation.
 The most useful ones to override are probably these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>require</strong>: The host's implementation of the require function.
 The default implementation throws an exception indicating that the host
 does not support any external modules.</li>
<li><strong>get</strong>: A function to retrieve the value of an input. The default
 implementation returns the the value specified by a provideInput() call, or
 if there has been no provideInput() call, then the value provided in the
 options argument of the this.input() call, or null if there is no value.</li>
<li><strong>getParameter</strong>: A function to retrieve the value of a parameter. The default
 implementation returns the the value specified by a this.setParameter() call, or
 if there has been no this.setParameter() call, then the value provided in the
 options argument of the this.parameter() call, or null if there is no value.</li>
<li><strong>send</strong>: A function to send an output. The default implementation produces
 the output using console.log().</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="description">
    <p>Create (using new) an accessor instance whose interface and functionality is given by
 the specified code. This will evaluate the specified code, and if it exports a
 setup() function, invoke that function. The created object includes at least the
 following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>accessorName</strong>: The name of the instance provided to the constructor.</li>
<li><strong>exports</strong>: An object that includes any properties that have have been
explicitly added to the exports property in the specified code.</li>
<li><strong>inputList</strong>: An array of input names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>inputs</strong>: An object with one property per input (see below).</li>
<li><strong>outputList</strong>: An array of output names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>outputs</strong>: An object with one property per output (see below).</li>
<li><strong>parameterList</strong>: An array of parameter names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>parameters</strong>: An object with one property per parameter (see below).</li>
<li><strong>inputHandlers</strong>: An object indexed by input name with
an array of input handlers, each of which is a function.</li>
<li><strong>anyInputHandlers</strong>: An array of input handlers to be invoked
when any input arrives (the name argument of addInputHandler is null).</li>
<li><p><strong>inputHandlersIndex</strong>: An object indexed by handler id (returned
by this.addInputHandler()) that contains objects of the form
{'name': nameOfInput, 'index': arrayIndexOfHandler}.
This is used by this.removeInputHandler(). If the handler is one
for any input, then nameOfInput is null and arrayIndexOfHandler
specifies the position of the handler in the anyInputHandlers array.</p>
<p>Inputs, outputs, and parameters have a defined order. The <code>inputList</code> 
property is an array giving the name of each input in the order in which it 
is defined in the setup() function. For each entry in that array, there is 
a property by that name in the <code>inputs</code> object, indexed by the name. 
The value of that property is the options object given to the <code>input()</code> 
function, possibly with additional properties such as 'destination', which 
is used for composite accessors. Similarly, parameters and outputs are 
represented in the data structure by an array of names and an object with the 
options values.</p>
<p>The returned instance may also include the following properties:</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>accessorClass</strong>: The class name of the accessor, if not anonymous.</p>
</li>

<div class="description">
    <p>Create (using new) an accessor instance whose interface and functionality is given by
 the specified code. This will evaluate the specified code, and if it exports a
 setup() function, invoke that function. The created object includes at least the
 following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>accessorName</strong>: The name of the instance provided to the constructor.</li>
<li><strong>exports</strong>: An object that includes any properties that have have been
explicitly added to the exports property in the specified code.</li>
<li><strong>inputList</strong>: An array of input names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>inputs</strong>: An object with one property per input (see below).</li>
<li><strong>outputList</strong>: An array of output names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>outputs</strong>: An object with one property per output (see below).</li>
<li><strong>parameterList</strong>: An array of parameter names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>parameters</strong>: An object with one property per parameter (see below).</li>
<li><strong>inputHandlers</strong>: An object indexed by input name with
an array of input handlers, each of which is a function.</li>
<li><strong>anyInputHandlers</strong>: An array of input handlers to be invoked
when any input arrives (the name argument of addInputHandler is null).</li>
<li><p><strong>inputHandlersIndex</strong>: An object indexed by handler id (returned
by this.addInputHandler()) that contains objects of the form
{'name': nameOfInput, 'index': arrayIndexOfHandler}.
This is used by this.removeInputHandler(). If the handler is one
for any input, then nameOfInput is null and arrayIndexOfHandler
specifies the position of the handler in the anyInputHandlers array.</p>
<p>Inputs, outputs, and parameters have a defined order. The <code>inputList</code> 
property is an array giving the name of each input in the order in which it 
is defined in the setup() function. For each entry in that array, there is 
a property by that name in the <code>inputs</code> object, indexed by the name. 
The value of that property is the options object given to the <code>input()</code> 
function, possibly with additional properties such as 'destination', which 
is used for composite accessors. Similarly, parameters and outputs are 
represented in the data structure by an array of names and an object with the 
options values.</p>
<p>The returned instance may also include the following properties:</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>accessorClass</strong>: The class name of the accessor, if not anonymous.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>containedAccessors</strong>: A list of contained accessors, if this is a composite
accessor or a mutable Accessor.</li>
<li><strong>container</strong>: A reference to the containing accessor, if this instance is
instantiated by a composite accessor.</li>
<li><strong>extendedBy</strong>: A reference to the accessor that this is extended by, if there is
one.</li>
<li><strong>extending</strong>: A reference to the accessor that this extends, if it extends one.</li>
<li><strong>implementedInterfaces</strong>: An array of interfaces that this accessor implements.</li>
<li><strong>root</strong>: The root of the extend/implement tree. This is the accessor instance
being invoked in a swarmlet, and each of the instances it extends or implements
will reference it in their root property.</li>
<li><p><strong>ssuper</strong>: If this accessor extends another, this is a reference to the instance
of the accessor it extends.</p>
<p>If the returned instance is a mutable accessor, then it will include these additional
properties:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>isMutable</strong>: set to true if the accessor is a mutable one.</li>
<li><strong>state</strong>: indicates the current state of the mutable accessor. It can be 'reified' or
'unreified'.</li>
<li><strong>inputsMap</strong>: An object that maps the mutable accessor inputs to the reifying accessor
inputs.</li>
<li><strong>outputsMap</strong>: An object that maps the mutable accessor outputs to the reifying accessor
outputs.</li>
<li><p><strong>reifyingAccessor</strong>: reference to the reifying accessor among all possible contained 
accessors.
Notes: (i) When a mutable accessor is reified, the attribute containedAccessors will contain
the selected accessor for reification (ii) A mutable accessor cannot extend another accessor.</p>
<p>The bindings parameter provides function bindings for functions that are used by
accessors.  Any that are not provided will be provided with defaults.
Any that are provided will override the defaults.</p>

<div class="description">
    <p>Process command line arguments to instantiate and initialize
 accessors or to evaluate plain JavaScript within the context of an
 accessor host. This is provided here in commonHost so that all
 accessor hosts that provide a command-line usage have the same
 command-line argument structure.</p>
<p> This function takes up to four arguments,
 where only the first is required.</p>
<p> The first argument is an array of
 command-line arguments (as detailed below).</p>
<p> The second (optional)
 argument is a function that given a file name, returns the contents
 of the file as a string. The second argument is needed only if
 plain JavaScript files are to be evaluated using the -js command-line
 argument.</p>
<p> The third (optional) argument is an instantiate function that
 takes two arguments, an accessor name (an arbitrary string) and an
 accessor class name. This argument is needed only if accessors class
 names are given on the command line to instantiate and initialize.</p>
<p> The fourth (optional) argument is a callback function to
 invoke when either a specified timeout is reached (if a timeout
 is provided), or all instantiated accessors have wrapped up
 and all specified JavaScript files have been evaluated. This argument
 may, for example, cause the calling process to exit.</p>
<p> For example, if a host provides a executable command named
 'host', then it might be invoked as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code> > host -t 1000 -js fileName.js test/TestAccessor</code></pre><p> The above command will evaluate the JavaScript in fileName.js, then
 instantiate the accessor with class name test/TestAccessor and
 initialize it, then wait one second and then call the terminate
 callback function.  For the above command to work, this function
 has to be provided a fileReader argument to read fileName.js.</p>
<p> The order in which files and accessors are specified matters. They
 will be evaluated or instantiated and initialized in the order that
 they appear in the argument list.</p>
<p> The command-line arguments are file names, accessor class names (such as
 net/REST), or any of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>-e|--e|-echo|--echo: Echo the command-line arguments.
This is helpful for use under Ant apply.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-h|--h|-help|--help: Print a usage message.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-j|--j|-js|--js: Interpret the next argument as the name of a regular
JavaScript file to evaluate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-k|--k|-keepalive|--keepalive: Keep the calling process alive until either
a timeout option expires or all instanted accessors have called wrapup.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-t|--t|-timeout|--timeout milliseconds: The maximum amount of time the
script can run. When this time is reached, stop() is called on all
accessors that have been instantiated, and then</p>
</li>
<li><p>-v|--v|-version|--version: Print out the version number</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <div class="container-overview">
    
        
            <div class="description"><p>This module provides host-independent functions for swarmlet hosts.
 A specific host (such as the Node.js host, the browser host, or the Ptolemy II
 host) can use this module to implement common functionality that is realizable
 in pure JavaScript.</p>
<h2> Instantiating Accessors</h2><p> Specifically, this module provides a constructor for instantiating accessors,
 and a convenience function (<strong>instantiateAccessor</strong>) that takes as an argument
 the fully qualified accessor class name, such as 'net/REST'.</p>
<p> For these functions to be able to instantiate an accessor given only its class name,
 the host needs to provide as an argument to new Accessor() or
 instantiateAccessor() a function, here designated getAccessorCode(), that
 will retrieve the accessor source code given the class name. This cannot be done
 in a host-independent way. For example, <code>getAccessorCode('net/REST')</code>
 should return the JavaScript  code defining the REST accessor.
 This function must also be provided if the host is to support accessor
 subclassing (extend()) or interface implementation (implement()).</p>
<p> The constructor and instantiate functions return an object that is an instance of an
 accessor. A specific host will typically use this by invoking the following
 instance's functions, perhaps in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>setParameter</strong>(name, value): Set a parameter value.</li>
<li><strong>initialize</strong>(): Initialize the accessor.</li>
<li><strong>provideInput</strong>(name, value): Provide an input value.</li>
<li><strong>react()</strong> React to input values and fire the accessor.</li>
<li><strong>latestOutput</strong>(name): Retrieve an output value produced in react().</li>
<li><strong>wrapup</strong>(): Wrap up the accessor.</li>
</ul>
<p> The react() function first invokes all input handlers that have been registered
 to handle provided inputs. It then invokes all input handlers that have been
 registered to handle any input.  Finally, it invokes the fire() function of the
 accessor, if one is defined.</p>
<h2> Events Emitted</h2><p> An instantiated accessor is an event emitter that emits the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>initialize</strong>: Emitted when the accessor has been initialized.</li>
<li><strong>output</strong>(<em>name</em>, <em>value</em>): Emitted when an output with the specified name
and value are sent.</li>
<li><strong>reactStart</strong> Emitted when a reaction is starting.</li>
<li><strong>reactEnd</strong>: Emitted when the accessor has reacted.</li>
<li><strong>wrapup</strong>: Emitted when the accessor has wrapped up.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Extend and Implement</h2><p> If a getAccessorCode() function is provided, then this implementation supports
 the <strong>extend</strong>() and <strong>implement</strong>() functions. An accessor A extends an accessor
 B if it includes in its setup() function a statement like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code> this.extend(B);</code></pre><p> In this case, there will be two accessor instances created, one for A and one for
 B. Somewhat confusingly, A will be the prototype of B. This may seem backwards,
 but there is a good reason for it. B omits several key properties, such as its
 lists of inputs, outputs, and parameters. And thus, when the setup() function of
 B creates an input, that input becomes an input of A.  Accessor A can reference
 the instance of B as A.ssuper.  The exported functions of B are accessible via
 as A.ssuper.exports or A.exports.ssuper.</p>
<p> Accessor A <strong>implements</strong> accessor B if its setup function includes:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code> this.implement(B);</code></pre><p> This case is similar, in that A becomes the prototype of B, but the instance of
 B is not available to A. The only interaction between the two is that when the
 setup() function of B is invoked, it will again create inputs, outputs, and
 parameters in A rather than in its own instance.</p>
<p> If A extends B, then the exports property of B becomes the prototype of the
 exports property of A.  This is the reverse of the prototype chain for the
 accessor instance itself. The reason for this is that B may define 'base-class'
 functions and properties that may or may not be overridden by A. These should
 be declared as exported properties.  For example, if B has a property:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code> exports.foo = 10;</code></pre><p> Then A can refer to foo as <code>exports.foo</code>. A can also override the value of
 foo by just writing to it.</p>
<h2> Composite Accessors</h2><p> If a getAccessorCode() function is provided, then this implementation supports
 composite accessors, which can instantiate other accessors (instantiate()) and
 connect them (connect()).  That is, an accessor may be defined as a hierarchical
 composition of other accessors.</p>
<p> If C is a composite accessor and you invoke C.provideInput(name, value) to
 provide an input to C, the same input will be automatically provided to any
 contained accessor that is connected to the input with the specified name.</p>
<p> Moreover, if C does not provide its own fire() function, then a default fire()
 function will invoke react() on any contained accessors that are provided with
 an input. If those contained accessors produce outputs, those will be provided
 as inputs to any connected accessors and then those will react as well.
 Finally, a contained accessor may send an output to an output of C, in which
 case the composite accessor will produce an output.</p>
<p> The reactions of contained accessors in a composite will occur in topological
 sort order (upstream accessors are assured of reacting first). This ensures that
 reactions of a composite are deterministic. Specifically, suppose that A, B, and
 D are all accessors contained by a composite C. Suppose that the output of A goes
 to both B and D, and that the output of B also goes to D. Then B will always react
 before D, since it is upstream of D.</p>
<p> A composition of accessors can have cycles, but at least one output in any
 directed cycle must have the option 'spontaneous' set to 'true'. This means that
 the output is not immediately produced as a reaction to an input, but rather will
 be produced some time later as a consequence of a callback. If there is no such
 marked output, then the cycle is a causality loop. There is no way to determine
 the order in which accessors should react.</p>
<h2> Mutable Accessors</h2><p> Mutable accessors are a particular type of composite accessors. They have the ability
 to dynamically change their behavior by substituting a contained accessor X by another
 accessor X'. The Mutable accessor can be used as a placeholder where a designer can
 plug in a discovered accessor. In this version, reification mechanism is quit open,
 assuming that the correctness is checked by third party (such as a Broker accessor...).
 Nevertheless, reification condition, in the sense of interface refinement, as pointed 
 out in 'Introduction to Embedded Systems' textbook (by Lee &amp; Seshia) can be called as
 a commomHost function, that is isReifyableBy(). </p>
<p> When calling 'reify' function on a particular accessor X, the Mutable Accessor
 will connect to X, making it equivalent to X itself. This is enabled by the composition
 mechanism. And this is done on runtime. If there is a previous reified accessor, it is
 unreified.</p>
<p> The choice of the accessor to be used for reification can be handled by another accessor
 or actor. </p>
<p> At any time, a previous reification can be removed. This will make the Mutable Accessor
 equivalent to an interface again. Consequently, another reification may be performed,
 enabling thus dynamic substitution.</p>
<h2> Spontaneous Accessors</h2><p> An accessor need not have any inputs. In this case, an invocation of react()
 will not invoke any input handlers (there cannot be any) and will only invoke the
 fire() function.  Even with no fire() function, such an accessor can produce outputs
 if it sets up callbacks in its initialize() function, for example using
 setTimeout() or setInterval(). We call such an accessor a <strong>spontaneous accessor</strong>,
 because it spontaneously produces outputs without being triggered by any input.</p>
<p> A composite accessor can contain spontaneous accessors. When these produce outputs,
 the composite accessor will automatically react. Hence, the contained spontaneous
 accessor can trigger reactions of other contained accessors.</p>
<h2> Overriding Function Bindings</h2><p> A particular accessor host (such as the browser host or Node.js host) can
 provide an accessor instance with specific implementations of various functions
 that the accessor invokes. Such custom function
 bindings will override the defaults in this implementation.
 The most useful ones to override are probably these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>require</strong>: The host's implementation of the require function.
 The default implementation throws an exception indicating that the host
 does not support any external modules.</li>
<li><strong>get</strong>: A function to retrieve the value of an input. The default
 implementation returns the the value specified by a provideInput() call, or
 if there has been no provideInput() call, then the value provided in the
 options argument of the this.input() call, or null if there is no value.</li>
<li><strong>getParameter</strong>: A function to retrieve the value of a parameter. The default
 implementation returns the the value specified by a this.setParameter() call, or
 if there has been no this.setParameter() call, then the value provided in the
 options argument of the this.parameter() call, or null if there is no value.</li>
<li><strong>send</strong>: A function to send an output. The default implementation produces
 the output using console.log().</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="description">
    <p>Create (using new) an accessor instance whose interface and functionality is given by
 the specified code. This will evaluate the specified code, and if it exports a
 setup() function, invoke that function. The created object includes at least the
 following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>accessorName</strong>: The name of the instance provided to the constructor.</li>
<li><strong>exports</strong>: An object that includes any properties that have have been
explicitly added to the exports property in the specified code.</li>
<li><strong>inputList</strong>: An array of input names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>inputs</strong>: An object with one property per input (see below).</li>
<li><strong>outputList</strong>: An array of output names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>outputs</strong>: An object with one property per output (see below).</li>
<li><strong>parameterList</strong>: An array of parameter names (see below).</li>
<li><strong>parameters</strong>: An object with one property per parameter (see below).</li>
<li><strong>inputHandlers</strong>: An object indexed by input name with
an array of input handlers, each of which is a function.</li>
<li><strong>anyInputHandlers</strong>: An array of input handlers to be invoked
when any input arrives (the name argument of addInputHandler is null).</li>
<li><p><strong>inputHandlersIndex</strong>: An object indexed by handler id (returned
by this.addInputHandler()) that contains objects of the form
{'name': nameOfInput, 'index': arrayIndexOfHandler}.
This is used by this.removeInputHandler(). If the handler is one
for any input, then nameOfInput is null and arrayIndexOfHandler
specifies the position of the handler in the anyInputHandlers array.</p>
<p>Inputs, outputs, and parameters have a defined order. The <code>inputList</code> 
property is an array giving the name of each input in the order in which it 
is defined in the setup() function. For each entry in that array, there is 
a property by that name in the <code>inputs</code> object, indexed by the name. 
The value of that property is the options object given to the <code>input()</code> 
function, possibly with additional properties such as 'destination', which 
is used for composite accessors. Similarly, parameters and outputs are 
represented in the data structure by an array of names and an object with the 
options values.</p>
<p>The returned instance may also include the following properties:</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>accessorClass</strong>: The class name of the accessor, if not anonymous.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>containedAccessors</strong>: A list of contained accessors, if this is a composite
accessor or a mutable Accessor.</li>
<li><strong>container</strong>: A reference to the containing accessor, if this instance is
instantiated by a composite accessor.</li>
<li><strong>extendedBy</strong>: A reference to the accessor that this is extended by, if there is
one.</li>
<li><strong>extending</strong>: A reference to the accessor that this extends, if it extends one.</li>
<li><strong>implementedInterfaces</strong>: An array of interfaces that this accessor implements.</li>
<li><strong>root</strong>: The root of the extend/implement tree. This is the accessor instance
being invoked in a swarmlet, and each of the instances it extends or implements
will reference it in their root property.</li>
<li><p><strong>ssuper</strong>: If this accessor extends another, this is a reference to the instance
of the accessor it extends.</p>
<p>If the returned instance is a mutable accessor, then it will include these additional
properties:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>isMutable</strong>: set to true if the accessor is a mutable one.</li>
<li><strong>state</strong>: indicates the current state of the mutable accessor. It can be 'reified' or
'unreified'.</li>
<li><strong>inputsMap</strong>: An object that maps the mutable accessor inputs to the reifying accessor
inputs.</li>
<li><strong>outputsMap</strong>: An object that maps the mutable accessor outputs to the reifying accessor
outputs.</li>
<li><p><strong>reifyingAccessor</strong>: reference to the reifying accessor among all possible contained 
accessors.
Notes: (i) When a mutable accessor is reified, the attribute containedAccessors will contain
the selected accessor for reification (ii) A mutable accessor cannot extend another accessor.</p>
<p>The bindings parameter provides function bindings for functions that are used by
accessors.  Any that are not provided will be provided with defaults.
Any that are provided will override the defaults.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="description">
    <p>If called with argument true, then accessors that are subsequently
 instantiated whose class name begins with 'trusted/' and accessors
 that have no class at all (they are given as custom script in the
 swarmlet definition) will have a
 binding for the getTopLevelAccessors() function. Such accessors
 can see and manipulate peer accessors, so a host that allows such
 trusted accessors should ensure that all trusted accessors are
 locally defined rather than downloaded from untrusted sources.</p>

<div class="description">
    <p>Process command line arguments to instantiate and initialize
 accessors or to evaluate plain JavaScript within the context of an
 accessor host. This is provided here in commonHost so that all
 accessor hosts that provide a command-line usage have the same
 command-line argument structure.</p>
<p> This function takes up to four arguments,
 where only the first is required.</p>
<p> The first argument is an array of
 command-line arguments (as detailed below).</p>
<p> The second (optional)
 argument is a function that given a file name, returns the contents
 of the file as a string. The second argument is needed only if
 plain JavaScript files are to be evaluated using the -js command-line
 argument.</p>
<p> The third (optional) argument is an instantiate function that
 takes two arguments, an accessor name (an arbitrary string) and an
 accessor class name. This argument is needed only if accessors class
 names are given on the command line to instantiate and initialize.</p>
<p> The fourth (optional) argument is a callback function to
 invoke when either a specified timeout is reached (if a timeout
 is provided), or all instantiated accessors have wrapped up
 and all specified JavaScript files have been evaluated. This argument
 may, for example, cause the calling process to exit.</p>
<p> For example, if a host provides a executable command named
 'host', then it might be invoked as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code> > host -t 1000 -js fileName.js test/TestAccessor</code></pre><p> The above command will evaluate the JavaScript in fileName.js, then
 instantiate the accessor with class name test/TestAccessor and
 initialize it, then wait one second and then call the terminate
 callback function.  For the above command to work, this function
 has to be provided a fileReader argument to read fileName.js.</p>
<p> The order in which files and accessors are specified matters. They
 will be evaluated or instantiated and initialized in the order that
 they appear in the argument list.</p>
<p> The command-line arguments are file names, accessor class names (such as
 net/REST), or any of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>-e|--e|-echo|--echo: Echo the command-line arguments.
This is helpful for use under Ant apply.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-h|--h|-help|--help: Print a usage message.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-j|--j|-js|--js: Interpret the next argument as the name of a regular
JavaScript file to evaluate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-k|--k|-keepalive|--keepalive: Keep the calling process alive until either
a timeout option expires or all instanted accessors have called wrapup.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-t|--t|-timeout|--timeout milliseconds: The maximum amount of time the
script can run. When this time is reached, stop() is called on all
accessors that have been instantiated, and then</p>
</li>
<li><p>-v|--v|-version|--version: Print out the version number</p>
</li>
</ul>
