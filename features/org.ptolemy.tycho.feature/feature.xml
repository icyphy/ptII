      Ptolemy II actors and other code used by Triquetrum.

Triquetrum delivers an open platform for managing and executing scientific workflows. The goal of Triquetrum is to support a wide range of use cases, ranging from automated processes based on predefined models, to replaying ad-hoc research workflows recorded from a user&apos;s actions in a scientific workbench UI. It will allow to define and execute models from personal pipelines with a few steps to massive models with thousands of elements.

Besides delivering a generic workflow environment, Triquetrum also delivers extensions with a focus on scientific software. There is no a-priori limitation on target scientific domains, but the current interested organizations are big research institutions in materials research (synchrotrons), physics and engineering. 

Ptolemy II is an open-source software framework supporting experimentation with actor-oriented design. Actors are software components that execute concurrently and communicate through messages sent via interconnected ports. A model is a hierarchical interconnection of actors. In Ptolemy II, the semantics of a model is not determined by the framework, but rather by a software component in the model called a director, which implements a model of computation.  

This feature includes a subset of Ptolemy II classes that have been packaged as OSGi bundles.
