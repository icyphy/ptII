<h2>Major Features that were new in Ptolemy II 7.0</h2>

<h3><a name="sdfCodegen">SDF Code Generation</a></h3>

The SDF Template based C code generator (Codegen) generates code for
hierarchical Synchronous Dataflow (SDF), Finite State Machine (FSM) and
Heterochronous Dataflow Domain (HDF) models.

<p>Codegen has the following new features:
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII8.0/ptII/doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/jni/EmbeddedCActor.html#in_browser" target="_top">EmbeddedCActor</a> - Allows arbitrary C code to be embedded in a Java model.  The entire Java model can then be converted to C code and the code within the EmbeddedCActor will be used.
<li>Enhanced polymorphic type system
<li>Support for invoking the Java plotter from a C version of a model
<li><i>and many more</i>
</ul>

<h3>Ptalon</h3>

<p>Actor-oriented design is a common design strategy in embedded
system design, where actors are concurrent components which
communicate through ports by sending signals to one another. Such
systems are frequently modeled with block diagrams, where the blocks
represent systems and lines or arrows between blocks represent
signals. Examples include Simulink, LabView, and VHDL/Verilog.

<p>A common problem in such environments is managing complexity,
particularly when the designs become large. Most actor-oriented design
environments allow hierarchy, or systems (blocks) which are composed
of other systems (blocks). To take this a step further, we are
developing the Ptalon programming language, which allows users to
parameterize components with other components.

<p>We have developed a preliminary interpreter for the Ptalon language in
the context of Ptolemy II, a general-purpose design environment for
actor-oriented systems. We have also developed a mathematical
framework for such languages, to help aid our understanding . We are
currently investigating the resource management issues inherent in
supporting large block-diagram models.

<h3>Backtracking</h3>
A backtracking facility enables the system to restore its old
state. It has many applications in practice, and is especially
important to high-performance distributed computation.
		</p>
<p>In developing this sub-project, we highlight the
following (increasing) list of criteria:
			</p>
<ul>

<li><em>Performance</em>. The highest priority is awarded to the
performance of the resulting system (the Ptolemy II system with
backtracking support built in), as compared to the original
system. Novel approaches are employed mainly to improve performance,
with moderate complexity added.
</li>

<li><em>Automatic transformation</em>. Transformation from the original
system to the backtracking-enabled system must be automated as much as
possible. Due to the size of the existing system, it is not realistic
to require a manual recoding in most of its sources. Moreover, coding
the backtracking sub-system by hand makes it hard to debug and evolve
over time./li>
<li><em>Clean interface to other parts</em>. The
backtracking sub-system must reveal a small but powerful
interface to the other parts in the system. It provides
the users with functions such as creating checkpoints,
undoing multiple language-level operations by backtracking
to a previous checkpoint, and even redoing those
operations to achieve some form of laziness.
</ul>

</ul>

The continuous domain models systems with continuous dynamics, including
for example analog circuits and mechanical systems, but also
cleanly supports discrete events, modal behaviors, and signals that
mix continuous-time behaviors with discrete events.
Models for continuous dynamics are equivalent to linear or nonlinear
integral equations. A sophisticated numerical solver for these equations
is integrated with the director.
The clean semantics of the Continuous domain enables its integration
in hierarchical heterogeneous models that use the Synchronous/Reactive (SR)
and Discrete Event (DE) domains. Arbitrary hierarchical mixtures of these
domains are supported, although if SR is at the top level, then the
<i>period</i> parameter of the director must be used so that time advances.
Domain interactions are documented in the following paper:

<h3><a name="graphTransformation">Graph Transformation</h3>

<p>The graph transformation facility provides a framework for the
analysis and transformation of actor models using graph transformation
techniques.

<p>The design of large-scale models poses a number of challenges. As
the size of the models increases to thousands of actors or hundreds of
thousands of actors, analysis and consistent modification on the
models become extremely hard. Furthermore, to maximize component
reuse, a systematic approach is needed for the specification and
maintenance of common patterns in the models and the transformation of
those patterns.

<p>The model transformation framework to be developed in this project
aims to support the flexible specification of patterns and
replacements by means of rules in graph grammar. An intuitive
graphical user interface will be built. For novice users, a set of
common transformations will be included in a library to facilitate
their common tasks.

<p>The transformations are models in their own right. They can be
embedded in larger models hierarchically. Heterogeneous models of
computation can be used to control the application of individual
"atomic" transformations. This makes it easy to create sophisticated
transformations by composing simple ones in a manageable and
disciplined way. The sophisticated transformations will also take
advantage of the concurrency inherent in those models of computation.

<p>Model transformation can be applied as an optimization of modal
models. These are hierarchical state machines with refinements in
their states, which are sub-models to be executed when those states
are active. The current implementation includes the complete
description of each refinement in the model description, even though
refinements of the states in a state machine tend to have large
commonality. With the transformation technique, only one refinement
needs to be stored completely. The others are obtained by
transformations performed on the stored refinement. This eliminates
redundancy and eases the job of modifying multiple refinements
consistently.

<p>Other applications of the model transformation technique include
recognizing common design patterns in the models in a static analysis,
replacing exiting design patterns with more efficient ones, and
reusing design patterns by incorporating them into new models.

<h2><a name="other">Other Key New Capabilities</a></h2>
<h3>ArrayType changes surrounding length</h3>

The <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/type/ArrayType.html">ArrayType</a> class
now represents the length of arrays.  New methods were added:

<pre>
boolean hasKnownLength()
int length()
</pre>          
The length() method throws a RuntimeException if invoked on an 
ArrayType with hasKnownLength() == false.
          
<p>Existing ArrayType instances (creating using the ArrayType(Type)
constructor have unknown length.  A new constructor ArrayType(Type,
int) creates array types with a known length.  Generally speaking,
array types with known length are incomparable with array types with
different lengths, and can be converted to an array type with unknown
length and compatible element type.  Scalars are convertible to array
types with length 1.  Getting the code to do this right was
significantly more complex than inferring sizes of Fix-point types
because:

<ol>

<li>The FixType modifications were easily factored since any FixType
with a known length is less than the single FixType with an unknown
length.  ArrayType could not be factored this way because of the more
complex type relations.

<li>FixType doesn't have a contained type variable.
</ol>
          
ArrayTypes now have a type construction functions: arrayType(int) and
arrayType(int, 4) represent the types that you might expect.

<p> Unfortunately, this means that there is <b>a signficant
backward-compatibility issue</b> Previously, if you wanted to force an
arbitrary integer array type, you used {int}, which is really an array
with one element.  This now has the type arrayType(int, 1), which is
more specific than you probably want.

<p>The existing models have been updated using the new description
of an array type with an unknown length.

<p>Note that arrayType(int) returns an instance of the special class
UnsizedArrayToken, whose only purpose is to have an unknown array
size.  Regular array tokens always have a known length.
          
<p>Note also that arrayType(unknown) is no longer the GLB of all of
the arrayTypes.  The GLB is now represented by BaseType.ARRAY_BOTTOM
(which is not an instance of ArrayType).  This required moving farther
along the path of decoupling type constraints on array element types
from the type objects themselves.  TypeableElementTypeTerm can now
refer to the element type of a typeable which may never esolve to a
valid array type (resulting in an unsatisifed inequality term).

<h2><a name="bugs">Bug fixes</a></h2>

<h2>Backward Compatibility</h2>


Most models developed under Ptolemy II 1.0.1,
2.0.1, 3.0.2, 4.0.1, 5.0.2  or HyVisual 2.2-beta, 3.0, 4.0.1, 5.0.1, 6.0.2
should run under Ptolemy II 7.0.1

<p>The MoMLParser includes a list of backward
compatibility filters that make certain changes on models
when read, handling such issues as actors being moved or renamed
and parameter names being changed.
The filters themselves are defined in
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/moml/filter/package-summary.html">
ptolemy.moml.filter</a>.
If you have developed your own actors under earlier versions of Ptolemy II by
writing your own Java files, you should recompile all your java code with
the new release.  In theory, copying the .class files should work, but
recompiling is safer.


<h2>Major Features that were new in Ptolemy II 6.0</h2>

<ul>
<li> (Was ../ptolemy/codegen/README.html, see <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII6.0/ptII/ptolemy/codegen/README.html">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII6.0/ptII/ptolemy/codegen/README.html</a>) Ptolemy II C Code Generation</a>
 <br>Primary Developers: Jackie Leung, Gang Zhou, Ye Zhou, Edward A. Lee,
	Christopher Brooks
 <br>  Ptolemy II can now generate C code for SDF, FSM and HDF models.
  This new code generator consists of actor templates (called helpers)
  that contain C code stubs that are stitched together.  Only a subset
  of actors have helpers, so only a subset of models can be converted
  to C.  Creating new helpers is fairly easy though.  The code generator
  has been written to be easily extensible to languages other than C.


<li> The
<a href="../ptolemy/domains/rendezvous/doc/body.htm" target="body">Rendezvous domain</a>:
 <br>Primary Authors: Thomas Huining Feng, Edward A. Lee
 <br>In the Rendezvous domain in Ptolemy II, each actor executes in
its own thread of control, and communication between actors is
by rendezvous.  If an actor is ready to send a message,
it blocks until the receiving actor is ready to receive it. Similarly if
an actor is ready to receive a message, it blocks until the sending actor
is ready to send it.
<p>
This domain supports both conditional and multi-way rendezvous.
In conditional rendezvous, an actor is willing to rendezvous with
any one of several other actors. In multiway rendezvous, an actor requires
rendezvous with multiple other actors at the same time.
When using conditional rendezvous, the choice of which rendezvous
occurs is nondeterministic, in general.
<P>
The model of computation is based on the Communicating Sequential
Processesmodel first proposed by Hoare in 1978. Rendezvous-based
communication is also known as synchronous message passing, but we
avoid this term to avoid confusion with the SR (synchronous/reactive)
domain.

<h2><a name="other">Other Key New Capabilities in 6.0</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/CaseDirector.html">CaseDirector</a><a name="Case"></a>
 <br>Primary Author: Edward A. Lee
 <br>The Case actor has been further developed so that it is easier
to build models that execute one of several refinements.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/Publisher.html">Publisher</a>,
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/Subscriber.html">Subscriber</a> and
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/SubscriptionAggregator.html">SubscriptionAggregator</a>
 <br>Primary Authors: Raymond Cardillo, Edward A. Lee 
<br>These actors use publish/subscribe semantics to read
and write tokens on a named channel.  
 The tokens are
 "tunneled" to any instance of Subscriber that names the same channel
 and that is under the control of the same director. That is, it can
 be at a different level of the hierarchy, or in an entirely different
 composite actor, as long as the relevant composite actors are
 transparent (have no director).

<li> A Token can now be "nil", which means that the data is missing.
If <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/Token.html#nil()">Token.nil()</a> is
called, it indicates that a token is a nil or missing token, which contains no data.
  Nil or missing tokens are common in analytical systems like R and SAS
  where they are used to handle sparsely populated data sources.
  In database parlance, missing tokens are sometimes called 
  null tokens.  Since null is a Java keyword, we use the term "nil".
The PN (../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/RemoveNilTokens/RemoveNilTokens demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
demo illustrates use of nil tokens.

<h2>
<a name="features"> Additional Features in 6.0</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Actor and model documentation system
 <br>Primary Authors: Edward A. Lee, Christopher Brooks.
 <br>Actor and model documentation is now displayed using a custom
 widget.  The documentation for an actor or model can be edited by 
 the user.  To view the documentation for an actor, right click on 
 the actor and select Documentation -&gt; Get Documentation.
 This functionality is implemented using
 <a
 href="codeDoc/ptolemy/vergil/actor/DocTableau.html">DocTableau</a>
 and other classes in vergil.actor and the
 <a href="codeDoc/doc/doclets/PtDoclet.html">PtDoclet</a> doclet.

<li> Relation Groups
Relations mediate connections between ports. For flexibility,
particularly with visual syntaxes, the Ptolemy II abstract syntax
permits any number of relations to be involved in any one
connection. Relations may be linked to
other relations. Any two relations that are linked are said to be
members of the same relation group. Specifically, a relation group is
a maximal set of linked relations. Semantically, a relation group has
the same meaning as a single relation.
The API of the Relation class, support linking and unlinking
relations, and also provides a method to obtain a list of all the
relations in a relation group.

<p>In a relation group, there is no significance to the order in which
relations are linked, unlike the order in which ports are linked to
relations. Also, unlike links between relations and ports, there is no
significance to multiple links between the same relations. Any two
relations are either linked or not linked.

capabilities in Ptolemy II...  Currently, if you create an actor
that implements the ExceptionHandler interface and put it into a model,
then any exception that occurs when the model is executes gets delegated
to that actor.  The first such actor is a test actor that can be used
to make regression tests that ensure that an exception is thrown.

<h2>
<a name="bugs"> Bug fixes in 6.0</a>
</h2>
<ul>

<li> Fixed memory leaks in MoMLParser
<li> Create hierarchy didn't work with classes
<li> Undo didn't always work with classes
<li> Couldn't drop a director (or anything containing a SharedParameter)
     into a class that already had an instance.
<li> Relation groups didn't always work with hierarchy.
<li> Paste of hierarchical models would mess up locations on the inside.

<li> The highlighting of classes and of inherited elements is now opaque.
They used to be translucent so that the highlights could compose even
though they overlapped.  However, if you print a model to EPS or PDF,
the presence of translucent elements forces the rendition to be
rasterized. This results is a major loss of quality...
<li> Paste of relations not properly offset.

<h2>Major Features that were new in Ptolemy II 5.1 </h2>

<menu>
<li> <a href="../ptolemy/configs/viptos/intro.htm">Viptos</a> - an interface
between TinyOS and Ptolemy II
</menu>

<h3>Major Features that were new in Ptolemy II 5.0 Highlights</h3>


<ul>
<li> <i>Dynamic Dataflow</i>:
(../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/HanoiTower/HanoiTower demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
(see also
(../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/Eratosthenes/Eratosthenes demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0),
(../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/IfThenElse/IfThenElse demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0),
(../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/Loop/Loop demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0),
(../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/OrderedMerge/OrderedMerge demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0),
(../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/RandomWalk/RandomWalk demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0))
<br>
In dynamic dataflow (DDF) models, actors are fired in response to available
input data. The schedule is dynamic and data dependent, and actors can
change their production and consumption rates in each firing.
Unlike synchronous dataflow, the DDF model of computation is Turing
complete, and questions of deadlock and boundedness are undecidable.
The (../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/HanoiTower/HanoiTower demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
example exploits this to give an algorithmic solution to the well-known
towers of Hanoi problem.

<br>
<li>
<i>Modeling of hybrid systems</i>:
(../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/NewtonsCradle/NewtonsCradleComplicated.htm) NewtonsCradleComplicated.
<br>
<i>Hybrid systems</i> are a special case of modal models
where finite-state machines (FSMs) are combined with the continuous-time (CT) models
to get mixed continuous-time and discrete-event models.
The HyVisual package
is a subset of Ptolemy II that includes the FSM and CT domains and libraries
that support the design of hybrid systems.
Version 5.0 introduces significant rework of the hybrid systems
modeling infrastructure to have more complete and predictable
semantics, as described in the paper
"<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/05/OperationalSemantics/#in_browser" target="_top">
Operational Semantics of Hybrid Systems</a>".
The
(../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/NewtonsCradle/NewtonsCradleComplicated.htm) NewtonsCradleComplicated
example illustrates this with a model of a physical system that has simultaneous
events.

<br>
<li><i>Stochastic hybrid systems</i>:
(../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Spontaneous/IncreasingRatePoisson.htm) IncreasingRatePoisson
(see also
(../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Hysteresis/HysteresisWithRandomDelay.htm) HysteresisWithRandomDelay,
(../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Brownian/Brownian.htm) Brownian
).
<br>
Stochastic hybrid systems add random behavior to continuous-time models mixed
with discrete events. The 
(../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Spontaneous/IncreasingRatePoisson.htm) IncreasingRatePoisson
models spontaneous mode transitions governed by a Poisson process.
The (../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Hysteresis/HysteresisWithRandomDelay.htm) HysteresisWithRandomDelay
example uses similar spontaneous mode transitions to model random delay in mode transitions.
The (../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Brownian/Brownian.htm) Brownian example
models a stochastic differential equation describing a random walk process.

<br>
<li> <i>Heterochronous Dataflow</i>:
(../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Fibonacci/Fibonacci demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
(see also
(../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Merge/Merge demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)).
<br>
Heterochronous dataflow (HDF) is an extension of synchronous dataflow
(SDF) that permits dynamically changing production and consumption
patterns without sacrificing static scheduling. In SDF, the production
and consumption patterns of an actor are constant.
In HDF they are allowed to change between iterations of the HDF schedule.
Modal models can be used to change these patterns.
Although HDF can express many data-dependent computations that cannot
be represented by SDF, it is not Turing complete.  Consequently, deadlock
and boundedness remain decidable.
The (../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Fibonacci/Fibonacci demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
example uses this mechanism in a clever way to extract a Fibonacci sequence
from a counting sequence.

</ul>

<h2><a name="other">Other Key New Capabilities</a>
</h2>
<ul>

<li><i>Unbounded model time</i>: LongRuns
<br>
Version 5.0 introduces a new
<a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/util/Time.html">Time</a> class
that represents model time in a manner that has a specified resolution
and unbounded growth potential. Any two time values that are within the specified
resolution are treated as equal. Moreover, time can increase forever without
concern for loss of resolution or overflow.
The LongRuns
example is a discrete-event model that can be run forever, in principle,
without (significant) growth of memory requirements and without loss
of (internal) precision in model time.
The precision of time representations is given by a director parameter
whose value is shared across all directors in a model (see
<a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/parameters/SharedParameter.html">SharedParameter</a>).
<br>

<li><i>Synchronous Reactive Modeling</i>:
(../ptolemy/domains/sr/demo/GuardedCount/GuardedCount demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0).
<br>
The synchronous/reactive (SR) domain,
which is inspired by the synchronous languages Esterel, Lustre, and Signal,
realizes a concurrency model where actors react instantaneously and simultaneously
at ticks of a logical clock. Version 5.0 introduces a richer set of actors
for use with this domain, as well as a bug fix permitting
SROptimizedScheduler to be used inside a composite actor.
The (../ptolemy/domains/sr/demo/GuardedCount/GuardedCount demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
example illustrates some of these new capabilities.
The new actors are:
<ul>
 <li> <a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/domains/sr/lib/Current.html">Current</a>

<li><i>Nondeterministic merge in Process Networks (PN)</i>:

<br>
The PN domain now supports a NondeterministicMerge actor, which merges two
incoming streams nondeterministically. This new actor should be used with
caution, since determinism is one of the key features of PN. Use of this
actor is risky because any given execution is only representative of
the possible executions. Nonetheless, this offers a considerable
increment in expressiveness.

<br>

<li><i>New Parameters</i>:
<br>
A number of new parameters have been introduced.
The <a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/parameters/DoubleRangeParameter.html">DoubleRangeParameter</a>
limits the range and precision of a double-valued parameter,
and is supported in the user interface by providing a slider by default in parameter
editing dialogs.
The <a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/parameters/FilePortParameter.html">FilePortParameter</a>
is used by actors to specify a file or URL using both a
parameter and a port. The user interface supports this by offering a file browser
dialog by default when editing this parameter. The
<a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/parameters/SharedParameter.html">SharedParameter</a>
is a parameter
whose value is constrained to be identical to a suite of other instances of
SharedParameter in the same model. This parameter is used, for example, to
handle seeds in random number generators, as illustrated for example in
ColtRandom.

<br>
<li><i>Higher Order Components</i>:
ExecDemos
(see also
(../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/IterateOverArray/IterateOverArray demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)).
<br>
The higher-order component capabilities of Ptolemy II continue to evolve.
The ExecDemos model, when executed, starts a new
Java virtual machine that then executes the
RunDemos model,
which runs all demos in a specified directory using full-screen mode.
This illustrates how to use higher-order actors to control the lifecylcle of other Ptolemy II
models. This example can be set up to automatically and repeatedly run demos
unattended by following the instructions in the
<a href="../ptolemy/demo/README.txt">README.txt</a> file.
The new higher-order actors include:
<ul>
 <li> <a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/ApplyFilterOverArray.html">ApplyFilterOverArray</a>
 <li> <a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/ApplyFunction.html">ApplyFunction</a>
 <li> <a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/ApplyFunctionOverSequence.html">ApplyFunctionOverSequence</a>
 <li> <a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/IterateOverArray.html">IterateOverArray</a>
</ul>

<li> <i>Graphics domain</i>:
(../ptolemy/domains/gr/demo/SolarSystem/SolarSystem demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
(see also (../ptolemy/domains/gr/demo/Helen/Helen demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)).
<br>
The graphics (GR) domain has been extensively revised to take better advantage of underlying
capabilities in the Java 3D package. For example, the
(../ptolemy/domains/gr/demo/SolarSystem/SolarSystem demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
model illustrates transparency (see the rings of Saturn), and the
(../ptolemy/domains/gr/demo/Helen/Helen demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0) model
illustrates texture mapping and movable viewer positioning.
The following capabilities are now supported:
<ul>
 <li>transparency
 <li>texture mapping
 <li>shininess
 <li>colors use ColorAttribute
 <li>more colors can be set
 <li>settable resolution
 <li>wireframe option for shapes
 <li>flat facets option for shapes
 <li>run-time changes of parameter values
 <li>parameters in the Text3D actor
 <li>movable viewer position
</ul>

</ul>

<h2><a name="libraries">New and Enhanced Actor Libraries</a>
</h2>
A number of new and enhanced actor libraries are included in version 5.0.
You may also wish to refer to the
<a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/package-summary.html">ptolemy.actor.lib</a>
package, where most of the domain-polymorphic actors reside (domain-polymorphic actors are
those that can be used in more than one domain).

<ul>
<li><i>New generic actors</i>:
<ul>
<li> <a href="../ptolemy/../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/Sequence.html">Sequence</a>
</ul>

<li><i>Random number generators</i>:
ColtRandom.
<br>
A new library of random number generators, developed jointly with
David Bauer and Kostas Oikonomou from AT&amp;T Research, is based on the popular
Colt "Open Source Libraries for High
Performance Scientific and Technical
Computing in Java."
Colt is described at
<a href="http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/#in_browser" target="_top">
<CODE>http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/</CODE></a>.
The library supports many
commonly used probability distributions and provides
systematic management of seeds and random number generation
techniques.

<h2>Major Features that are new in Ptolemy II 4.0</h2>
Below are new features that were not present in Ptolemy II 3.x
<ul>
<li>
(../ptolemy/domains/wireless/demo/WirelessSoundDetection/WirelessSoundDetection demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0) (see also
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/visualsense/visualsensedoc/#in_browser" target="_top">Ptolemy Web Site VisualSense PDF</a>).

<br>
The wireless domain extends the DE domain with wireless channel modeling and
library of components and methodologies for modeling wireless systems.
This domain is packaged in a Ptolemy II configuration called
VisualSense, which includes
an extensive suite of demos.

<li>
(../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/NoisySinewave/NoisySinewave demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0). (See also
<a href="../ptolemy/configs/doc/ClassesIllustrated.png">
classes illustrated visually</a> and
(../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/RijndaelEncryption/RijndaelEncryption demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)).
<br>
Version 4.0 introduces actor-oriented classes, subclasses, and
inner classes with inheritance. This is a major improvement in
the modularity mechanisms available in actor-oriented design. 
A side effect of the class mechanism is that MoML files are now
much smaller since they do not duplicate information defined
in a base class.

<li>
(../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/MultipleRuns/MultipleRuns demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0) (see also
(../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/ModelReference/ModelReference demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)).
<br>
Version 4.0 introduces the first of a family of
<i>lifecycle management</i> actors, which are actors
that control the execution of associated models.
This example uses one model to control repeated runs of another.

</ul>

<h2>Other Features that are new in Ptolemy II 4.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
(../ptolemy/data/unit/demo/StaticUnits/NonAppletStaticUnits demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0) (see also the older
(../ptolemy/data/unit/demo/Units/Units demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)).
<br>
The new statically checked units system associates
units with ports and checks compatibility in connections.

<li>
(../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/MobileFunction/MobileFunction demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0).
Version 4.0 adds <i>higher-order components</i>,
which are components (like actors) that operate on other
components and functions rather than directly on data.

<li>
(../ptolemy/vergil/kernel/attributes/demo/AnimateVergil/AnimateVergil demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0).
<br>
Actors can have custom icons, diagrams can be decorated with
decorative elements, and parameters of the icons and decorative
elements can be tied to values compute by the model.

<li>
(../ptolemy/domains/psdf/demo/BlindCommunication/BlindCommunication demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
<br>
A new capability helps to ensure the safe use of reconfiguration.
Currently it is primarily used by the code generator to
ensure that synchronous dataflow rate parameters are constant
over the lifetime of the model.  This analysis also enables
parameterized static scheduling of some models where rate parameters
change only between iterations of a sub-model.

<li> 
ptolemy/domains/de/demo/HierarchicalModel/HierarchicalModel.htm  (Removed in Ptolemy II 8.0)
(see also
(../ptolemy/domains/sr/demo/FeedbackLoop/FeedbackLoop demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)).
<br>
A new (and still evolving) capability unifies causality analysis
that is required by several domains. It provides a systematic
framework for determining whether events at a particular input
affect a particular output.

<li>
Copernicus
<br>
The copernicus code generator has matured significantly:
<ul>
<li>Better handling of data types, reconfiguration, and attributes other than
simple parameters.
<li>Code Generation for the Giotto domain.
<li>A primitive code generator for generating atomic actors from models.
<li>Static analysis of reachable code for generating self-contained jar files.
</ul>

This means that you can now reference parameters in scope using the
$name or ${name} syntax.  For instance, if there is a parameter named
foo, you can specify a Matlab expression like:
<pre>
    output = fft(in, $foo)
</pre>
Before, you would have to have read foo in a Const actor and
provided it as input to the Matlab expression actor.

<h2>Major Features that were new in Ptolemy 3.0 </h2>
<menu>

<li> Continuous Time (CT) domain rework for improved mixed signal and
hybrid systems semantics
(Jie Liu, Parc, and Haiyang Zheng).

<li> <a href="../ptolemy/domains/ci/doc/body.htm" target="body">Component Interaction Domain</a>
(Yang Zhao, Xiaojun Liu) - The CI domain models systems that contain
both data-driven and demand-driven styles of computation.

<li> Rework of FSM domain to support chained transitions
and better hybrid systems semantics (Haiyang Zheng).

<li> Expression language rework to create a full-featured, functional
and higher-order expression language with extensive support for
composite types such as matrices, arrays, and records;
the expression language is also now fully integrated with the Ptolemy II
type system
 (Steve Neuendorffer, Edward A. Lee).

<li> Configurations have been reworked to make it much easier to
create standalone tools that extract portions of the Ptolemy II
infrastructure and have customized user interfaces, documentation,
and actor and director libraries.
Configurations have been refactored into
separate directories in <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/configs</CODE>,
and one example of such a standalone tool, HyVisual, is provided.

<li> Updates to Vergil, the user interface for building models
(Steve Neuendorffer, Edward A. Lee, John Reekie):
	<menu>
	<li> Run buttons on the toolbar and hotkeys.
        <li> Persistent window sizing and placement.
	<li> Undo/Redo.
	<li> Port Parameters.
	<li><CODE>vergil -help</CODE> lists available configurations.
	<li> Full-screen mode for use in presentations.
        </menu>

<li> Other user interface improvements
(Steve Neuendorffer, Edward A. Lee):
        <menu>
        <li> Interactive shells infrastructure.
        <li> An interactive expression shell using this infrastructure.
	<li> Infrastructure for specialized token viewers.
        Files with the extension .ptd are now opened by a token viewer.
        The default token viewers is a text editor, but others can be
	added in the configuration.
	<li> A matrix token viewer.
        </menu>

<li> HSIF Support
(Haiyang Zheng).
The Hybrid System Interchange Format (HSIF), was developed by the
<a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu#in_browser" target="_top">
Institute of Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) at Vanderbilt University</a>
as part of the
<a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/Projects/mobies/default.html#in_browser" target="_top">ISIS MoBIES</a> effort.
The HSIF documentation states:
<menu>
"The goal of HSIF is to define an interchange format for hybrid system
models that can be shared between modeling and analysis tools. HSIF
models represent dynamic systems, whose dynamics includes both
continuous and discrete behaviors."
</menu>
Haiyang Zheng developed a set of XSLT files that convert
HSIF into MoML, the XML format used to represent Ptolemy II Models.
See the (../ptolemy/hsif/demo/index demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0).
</li>

<li> A first version of higher-order components, the
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/MultiInstanceComposite.html">
MultiInstanceComposite</a> actor
(Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, Research In Motion, Ltd.).
This actor creates a parameterized number of instances of a composite
actor.

<li>
Python integration, with a
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/python/PythonScript.html">PythonScript</a>
actor that permits definition of actors in Python (Xiaojun Liu).
This uses
<a href="http://www.jython.org/#in_browser" target="_top">Jython</a>,
a Java implementation of Python.
</menu>
<h2>Other Features that are new in Ptolemy II 3.0</h2>

<ul>

<li> Ptolemy II Matlab interface updates
(Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, Research In Motion, Ltd.):
<menu>
<li> Logical variable support for Matlab version 6.5 (R13).
<li> Remove (the need for) ptmatlab.dll being in the user's path.
<li> Removed warnings for gcc version 3.2 (used by latest cygwins).
<li> Add support/configuration for building on Linux.

These demos require that Matlab be installed locally; they will not work
within an applet, but will work with Web Start.

<li> <a href="http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/caltrop/index.html#in_browser" target="_top">Cal Actor Language (CAL)</a>
(J&ouml;rn W. Janneck, Chris Chang, Johan Ecker,
John Reekie, Yang Zhao, Ed Willink, Lars Wernli):

<br>The CAL actor language is a textual notation for representing the
functionality of dataflow actors. It is designed to allow low-entropy
descriptions of actors by providing statically analyzable information
about the behavior of an actor, such as the number of tokens it
produces and consumes in each firing, whether there are any conditions
on being able to fire, what those conditions depend on, etc.

<li> ($PTII/doc/codegen.htm, removed after ptII8.0, see $PTII/ptolemy/cg/README.html) Code Generator Documentation
(Steve Neuendorffer, Christopher Hylands):
The Java code generator now handles Expression actors.
The code generator now works with Java 1.4.
The applet generator has been extended to copy necessary jar
files on an as needed basis.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/FunctionToken.html">FunctionToken</a>
class (Xiaojun Liu, Steve Neuendorffer): An expression that defines a function
can be passed among actors in a function token.

<li> Transition Refinements: A transition in an FSM can have
a refinement, which is a model that executes when the refinement
is taken.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/kernel/attributes/FileAttribute.html">
FileAttribute</a> class
(Edward A. Lee).
This attribute makes it easy to create a parameter in an actor
that represents a file or resource. It supports specification
of files using paths relative to the model, the classpath, or
the user directory.  It also provides a convenient user interface for
selecting and accessing files on the file system.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/ImageToken.html">ImageToken</a> class
(James Yeh): An abstract token that contains images.  Derived tokens
such as 
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/AWTImageToken.html">
AWTImageToken</a>,
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/jai/JAIImageToken.html">
ptolemy.actor.lib.jai.JAIImageToken</a>
provide concrete classes.

<li> Interface to C actors using the Java Native Interface
(Vincent Arnould, Thales, contributor: Christopher Hylands):
The <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII4.0/ptII/doc/codeDoc/jni/package-summary.html#in_browser" target="_top">jni</a>
package contains a prototype of an interface between Ptolemy II actors
and C code by using the Java Native Interface (JNI).
To use this facility, you must download and install Ptolemy II 
from source.
(This interface shipped in Ptolemy II 4.0, but not in Ptolemy II 5.0).

<li>HSIF Thermostat and Swimming Pool
<br> This example shows a simple thermostat modeled as a hybrid system.
The purpose of the example is to demonstrate the ability that HyVisual has
to import models defined in HSIF, the <i>Hybrid System Interchange Format</i>.
To run HSIF models, you must invoke Ptolemy II with the <CODE>-hyvisual</CODE>
command line argument or else run the HyVisual Web Edition.  These
models will not work in a standard Ptolemy II vergil or Web Edition
because to support HSIF, we need to check xml each file to see
if it is an HSIF file of a MoML file.  This check slows Ptolemy II
down slightly.

<h2>Major Features that are new in Ptolemy 2.0 </h2>
<menu>

<li> (../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/ModalModel/ModalModel demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
 (Xiaojun Liu, Edward A. Lee)
<br>A model model is one whose behavior depends on its "mode"
of operation. A modal model in Ptolemy II is an FSM (finite state machine)
combined hierarchically with other models. A state in the FSM represents
a mode of operation, and can have a refinement that gives the behavior
in that model.
The refinement can be another FSM or some other model using some other
Ptolemy domain. This example combines DE, FSM, and SDF to model a
system where regularly sampled signals are perturbed by irregular
events in time.
</li>

<li> ($PTII/doc/codegen.htm, removed after ptII8.0, see $PTII/ptolemy/cg/README.html) Code Generator Documentation
(Primary Author: Stephen Neuendorffer, Contributor: Christopher Hylands)
 <br>This release includes a limited prototype of our code generation facility
that will generate .class files for non-hierarchical SDF models.

 <br>Note that the code generator will not work in an applet, but will
work with Web Start, the Windows installer and the standard configure
and build.

<li> <a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/data/unit/package-summary.html">ptolemy.data.unit</a> -
(../ptolemy/data/unit/demo/Units/Units demo, Applets not well supported by Java after Ptolemy II 8.0)
(Primary Authors: Yuhong Xiong, Xiaojun Liu, Contributors: Winthrop Williams, Edward A. Lee)
<br>
A major source of errors in embedded software is incorrect application
of units. Yuhong Xiong and Xiaojun Liu have created a unit system for
Ptolemy II that is quite clever. A suite of constants are defined, with
names such as "meter", "cm", "feet", "miles", "seconds", "hours", and
"days". In each unit category ("length" or "time" for example), there
is a primary unit with respect to which all the others are specified.
Thus, for example, if the primary unit of length is meters, then the
expression "1.0 * cm" will have an internal value of 0.01 * meters.
Compound units are specified by just multiplying and dividing, as in
for example "1.0 * cm/second".

<p>The way this is realized is that these unit constants are tokens just
like other Ptolemy II data, and multiplication and division are
overloaded in the base classes for numeric valued tokens.  We continue
to work on this architecture to enable users to customize the unit
system on a per-model basis.
