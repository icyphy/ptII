     * humans. This method generates that form so that humans can
     * easily understand the results generated by the system. For example, an
     * internal representation of a Unit could be 4.1868E7*&lt2, 1, 1, 0, 0&gt
     * and its descriptive form would be "calorie".
     * <p>
     * The descriptive form is invariant across Unit Systems. That is, calorie
     * is calorie regardless of the Unit System. But, the internal form may be
     * 4.1868E7*&lt2, 1, 1, 0, 0&gt in one Unit System, and
     * 1.0*&lt2, 1, 1, 0, 0&gt in another. Therefore the descriptive form is
     * used as the external representation. This makes it
     * possible to save a model under one Unit System, and then load it under a
     * different Unit System.
     * @return The descriptive form.
