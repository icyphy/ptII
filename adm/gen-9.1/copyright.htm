<p>Ptolemy II includes the work of others, to see those copyrights and licenses, follow
the copyright link on the splash page.  Various configurations of
Ptolemy include various copyrights, below we describe some of the
licenses and copyrights.  For any given Ptolemy configuration, follow
the Help -&gt; About -&gt; Copyright link to see what third party packages
are part of the configuration and what their copyrights are.</p>

<p>The short answer is that the Ptiny configuration, run by
running <code>$PTII/bin/vergil -ptiny</code> or by running the
Mac OS X <code>Ptiny.app</code> or by running the 
Windows "vergil -ptiny" executable uses only the Ptolemy copyright above,

<a href="#colt">Colt </a>,
<a href="#matlab">Matlab Expression Actor</a> and
<a href="#jython">Jython</a>.
Colt, Matlab Expression actor and Jython are all used by actors
specific to those packages.
The other license below
are used primarily by actors that interface to those libraries.</p>

date such rights begin is other than the purchase date, your Entitlement
will provide that beginning date(s).

<br>The Entitlement may be delivered to you in various ways depending on
the manner in which you obtain Software and Services, for example, the
Entitlement may be provided in your receipt, invoice or your contract
with Sun or authorized Sun reseller. It may also be in electronic format
if you download Software.

<li> Permitted Use.

<br>As selected in your Entitlement, one or more of the following Permitted
Uses will apply to your use of Software. Unless you have an Entitlement
that expressly permits it, you may not use Software for any of the other
Permitted Uses. If you don't have an Entitlement, or if your Entitlement
doesn't cover additional software delivered to you, then such software
is for your Evaluation Use.

and/or redistributable files, that may be handled differently, you may
do so only as provided in the Sun documentation. (c) You may not rent,
lease, lend or encumber Software. (d) Unless enforcement is prohibited by
applicable law, you may not decompile, or reverse engineer Software. (e)
The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any Software
updates, provided to you at Sun's discretion, that replace and/or

license. (f) You may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark
or comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior
written consent of Sun. (g) Software is confidential and copyrighted. (h)
Unless otherwise specified, if Software is delivered with embedded or
bundled software that enables functionality of Software, you may not
use such software on a stand-alone basis or use any portion of such

Software may contain programs that perform automated collection of
system data and/or automated software updating services. System data
collected through such programs may be used by Sun, its subcontractors,
and its service delivery partners for the purpose of providing you with
remote system services and/or improving Sun's software and systems. (j)
Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,
construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun
and its licensors disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness
for such uses. (k) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark,
service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted
under this Agreement.

<li> Java Compatibility and Open Source.

<br>Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional
classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
at www.java.net.

<br>Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions
and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of
its products.

<br>Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter
any rights and obligations you may have under such open source licenses,
however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions
in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this distribution.

<li> Term and Termination.

<br>The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). Your
rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from
Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's
and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this Agreement
should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to
become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or
trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of,
and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections
1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the Agreement.

<li> Limited Warranty.

<br>Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which
Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials
and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is
provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under
this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media
or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations
on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This
limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others,
which vary from state to state.

<li> Disclaimer of Warranty.

<br>UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
BE LEGALLY INVALID.

<li> Limitation of Liability.

<br>TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS
OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF
OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you,
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable
to you.

<li> Export Regulations.

<br>All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered
under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be
subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree
to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that
you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export,
or import as may be required after delivery to you.

<li> U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

<br>If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

<li> Governing Law.

<br>Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California
law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any
jurisdiction will apply.

<li> Severability.

<br>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

<li> Integration.

<br>This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is the
entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications,
proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any
conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or
other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter
during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will
be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative
of each party.

   is considered a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; subject to the terms and
   conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

<p>   The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
   any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
   section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
   case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
   Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
   future as another exception but one is not currently available.

<p>   As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
   permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
   RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
   regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
   and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
   provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
   copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
   combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General

   to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
   their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
   gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
</PRE>


<H3><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="#TOC2">Preamble</A></H3>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<P>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<P>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<P>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
<P>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<P>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
<P>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
<P>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
<P>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<P>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
<P>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="#TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H3>


<P>
<STRONG>0.</STRONG>
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<P>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<P>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<P>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
<P>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
<P>
<STRONG>1.</STRONG>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
<P>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
<P>
<STRONG>2.</STRONG>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG>
       The modified work must itself be a software library.
  <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG>
       You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  <LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG>
       You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  <LI><STRONG>d)</STRONG>
       If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
       <P>
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)
       <P>
       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
       on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
       it.
       <P>
       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Library.
       <P>
       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
       with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
       the scope of this License.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>3.</STRONG>
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
<P>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<P>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
<P>
<STRONG>4.</STRONG>
You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
<P>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<P>
<STRONG>5.</STRONG>
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<P>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<P>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<P>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<P>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<P>
<STRONG>6.</STRONG>
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
<P>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
<P>
<UL>
    <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)
	 
    <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    <LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    <LI><STRONG>d)</STRONG> If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    <LI><STRONG>e)</STRONG> Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</UL>
<P>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
<P>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
<P>
<STRONG>7.</STRONG> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<P>
<UL>
    <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>8.</STRONG> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<P>
<STRONG>9.</STRONG>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
<P>
<STRONG>10.</STRONG>
Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
<P>
<STRONG>11.</STRONG>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<P>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<P>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<P>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<P>
<STRONG>12.</STRONG>
If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
<P>
<STRONG>13.</STRONG>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<P>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
<P>
<STRONG>14.</STRONG>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
<P>
<STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>15.</STRONG>
BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<P>
<STRONG>16.</STRONG>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
<P>
<H3>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</H3>

<H3><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="#TOC4">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</A></H3>
<P>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).
<P>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<p>"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or
has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

<p>"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

<p>"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

<p>"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not
be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

<p>"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

<ul>
<li> You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

<li> You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in
such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

<li> You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when
you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site, or by allowing
the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of
the Package.
<br>b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
<br>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
differs from the Standard Version.
<br>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

<li> You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get
the Standard Version.
<br>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
with your modifications.
<br>c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names,
and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),
together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

<li> You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may
distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

<li> The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be
sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

<li> C or Java subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall
not be considered part of this Package.

<p>The libgcj library is licensed under the terms of the GNU General

<p>Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
combination.</p>

<p>As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked

<h3>GNU General Public License</h3>
<p>Version 2, June 1991</p>

<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>

<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>

<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>

<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>

<ol start="0">
<li><p>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>

<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p></li>

<li><p>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p></li>

<li><p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>

<li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>

<li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</li>
</ol>

<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>

<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p></li>

<li><p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</li>

<li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</li>

<li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>

<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p></li>

<li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p></li>

<li><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p></li>

<li><p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p></li>

<li><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>

<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>

<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p></li>

<li><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p></li>

<li><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p></li>

<li><p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

<p>NO WARRANTY</p></li>

<li><p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p></li>

<li><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<p>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author</p>

<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>

<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.</p>

<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.</p>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 
for details.</p>

<p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written 
by James Hacker.</p>

<p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.</p>

<h3>MySQL FLOSS License Exception</h3>

The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source
Software-only Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the
"FLOSS Exception").

<p>Version 0.6, 7 March 2007

<p>Exception Intent

<p>We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'')
applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS
licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (the ``GPL'').

<h3>Legal Terms and Conditions</h3>

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0
of the GPL:

<ol>
<li> You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed
    entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a
    "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses
    listed below in section 1, as long as:
    <br>  a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the
         Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the
         Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program,
         and which can reasonably be considered independent and
         separate works in themselves,
    <br>  b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which
         are not derived from the Program, and which can
         reasonably be considered independent and separate works
         in themselves,
          <br> i. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses
              listed below, and
          <br>ii. the object code or executable form of those sections
              are accompanied by the complete corresponding
              machine-readable source code for those sections on
              the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as
              the corresponding object code or executable forms of
              those sections, and
      <br>c. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a
         Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution
         medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be
         considered independent and separate works in themselves
         which are not derivatives of either the Program, a
         Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
    <br>If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only
    be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and
    conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from
    MySQL AB.

         meaning provided in the GPL.
      <br>b. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright
         law.

<li> Applicability: This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs
    that contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the
    Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS
    Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a
    Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work
    licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not
    available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS
    Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all
    respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may
    choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under
    the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice
    from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has
    never been modified by you or any third party.

        LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
        PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.</p>
      <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, 
        PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, 
        DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION 
        IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

      <p>Restricted Rights<br>
        If you distribute a license to the United States government, the programs, 
        including documentation, shall be considered commercial computer software 
        and you will place a legend, in addition to applicable copyright notices, 
        on the documentation, and on the media label, substantially similar to 
        the following:<br>
        NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS<br>
        "Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial 
        computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, 
        including documentation, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions 
        set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement. Otherwise, programs 
        delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted 
        computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, 
        including documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, 
        Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). Oracle USA, 
        Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065."</p>
      <p>End of Agreement<br>
        You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. 
        We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail 
        to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall 
        destroy all copies of the programs.</p>
      <p>Relationship Between the Parties<br>
        The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither 
        party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any 
        obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent 
        the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. 
        Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right 
        to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar 
        to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the 
        other party is not included in such software.</p>
      <p>Open Source<br>
        "Open Source" software - software available without charge for 
        use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that 
        require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software 
        or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software 
        freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software 
        in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: 
        (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the 
        Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party 
        any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary 
        rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software 
        program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such 
        use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle 
        program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) 
        if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any 
        "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine 
        the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public 
        License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be 
        interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications 
        thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.</p>
      <p>Entire Agreement<br>
        You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs 
        and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
        agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found 
        to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.</p>

<h3> HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE</h3>


<p>JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.

<p>In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
under the Jython specific license below.

<p>From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed
Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are
covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.

<p>The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation
license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.

<p>The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
Software License.

<p>The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software
License.  See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.

<h3> HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE</h3>

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

<p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

<p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

<p>All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

<br>(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

<p>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<ol>
   <li> Definitions.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

<br>      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

<br>      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

<br>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

<br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

<br>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   <li> Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   <li> Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   <li> Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      <br>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      <br>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      <br>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      <br>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      <br>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   <li> Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   <li> Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   <li> Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   <li> Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   <li> Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<blockquote>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</p><p>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

<h4><a name="section0"></a>0. Additional Definitions.</h4>

<p>As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

<p>An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked
Version&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

<h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h4>

<p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

<h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h4>

<p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>

<li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4>

<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.</li>

<li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Combined Works.</h4>

<p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.</li>

<li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.</li>

<li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>

<li>d) Do one of the following:

<ul>
<li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.</li>

<li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Combined Libraries.</h4>

<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>

<li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</p>

Version 2, June 1991
<PRE>
Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
</PRE>
<H3>
  <A NAME="SEC2v2" HREF="#TOC1v2">Preamble</A>
</H3>
<P>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
the software is free for all its users.
<P>
This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries
whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.
<P>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
you know you can do these things.
<P>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of
the library, or if you modify it.
<P>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you
link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to
the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms
so they know their rights.
<P>
Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.
<P>
Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library
is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know
that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
<P>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will
individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program
into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<P>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,
the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.
This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it
in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary
license.
<P>
The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they
blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program
and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the
library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running
a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal
sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original
library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.
<P>
Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License
for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most
developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions
might promote sharing better.
<P>
However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users
of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries
themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers
of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom
as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated
in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header
files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions
of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of
free libraries.
<P>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.
<P>
Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General
Public License rather than by this special one.
<H3>
  <A NAME="SEC3v2" HREF="#TOC1v2">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION
  AND MODIFICATION</A>
</H3>
<P>
<STRONG>0.</STRONG> This License Agreement applies to any software library
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General
Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
"you".
<P>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some
of those functions and data) to form executables.
<P>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)
<P>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.
<P>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent
of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true
depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library
does.
<P>
<STRONG>1.</STRONG> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer
to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy
of this License along with the Library.
<P>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<P>
<STRONG>2.</STRONG> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<UL>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>a)</STRONG> The modified work must itself be a software library.
    <P>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>b)</STRONG> You must cause the files modified to carry prominent
    notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    <P>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>c)</STRONG> You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at
    no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    <P>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>d)</STRONG> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function
    or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
    facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
    then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
    application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
    and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example,
    a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
    well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires
    that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function
    must still compute square roots.)
</UL>
<P>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must
be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
<P>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based
on the Library.
<P>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.
<P>
<STRONG>3.</STRONG> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General
Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To
do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead
of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU
General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead
if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
<P>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies
and derivative works made from that copy.
<P>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
into a program that is not a library.
<P>
<STRONG>4.</STRONG> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion
or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange.
<P>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
the object code.
<P>
<STRONG>5.</STRONG> A program that contains no derivative of any portion
of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work,
in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls
outside the scope of this License.
<P>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions
of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable
is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
of such executables.
<P>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that
is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative
work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true
is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library,
or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is
not precisely defined by law.
<P>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or
less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless
of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this
object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<P>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.
<P>
<STRONG>6.</STRONG> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile
or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for
the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
<P>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this
License. Also, you must do one of these things:
<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<UL>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were
    used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);
    and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
    machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source
    code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce
    a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library
    will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
    definitions.)
    <P>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>b)</STRONG> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection
    6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
    <P>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>c)</STRONG> If distribution of the work is made by offering access
    to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.
    <P>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>d)</STRONG> Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</UL>
<P>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
<P>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
together in an executable that you distribute.
<P>
<STRONG>7.</STRONG> You may place library facilities that are a work based
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library
and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided
that you do these two things:
<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<UL>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same
    work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.
    This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
    <P>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>b)</STRONG> Give prominent notice with the combined library of the
    fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where
    to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>8.</STRONG> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.
<P>
<STRONG>9.</STRONG> You are not required to accept this License, since you
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
<P>
<STRONG>10.</STRONG> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You
are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<P>
<STRONG>11.</STRONG> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<P>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<P>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.
Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
that choice.
<P>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.
<P>
<STRONG>12.</STRONG> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.
<P>
<STRONG>13.</STRONG> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<P>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<P>
<STRONG>14.</STRONG> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two
goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<P>
<STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>15.</STRONG> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<P>
<STRONG>16.</STRONG> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<P>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under
these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).
<P>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR
LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. QuickTime Player
automatically produces search results that reference sites and
information located worldwide throughout the Internet. Because Apple
has no control over such sites and information, Apple makes no
guarantees as to such sites and information, including: (i) the
accuracy, currency, content, or quality of any such sites and
information, or (ii) whether an Apple search completed through the
QuickTime Player may locate unintended or objectionable
content. Because some of the content on the Internet consists of
material that is adult-oriented or otherwise objectionable to some
people or viewers under the age of 18, the results of any search or
entering of a particular URL using the QuickTime Player may
automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to
objectionable material. By using the QuickTime Player, you acknowledge
that Apple makes no representations or warranties with regard to the
appropriateness of the content viewed through the QuickTime Player,
whether on a pre-installed channel button or as a result of your
search. Apple does not guarantee the sequence, accuracy, completeness
or timeliness of the content played through the QuickTime
Player. Apple, its officers, affiliates and subsidiaries shall not,
directly or indirectly, be liable, in any way, to you or any other
person for the content you receive using the QuickTime Player or for
any inaccuracies, errors in or omissions from the content.

<li> Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
EVENT SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLE
SOFTWARE, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY
(CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no
event shall Apple's total liability to you for all damages (other than
as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal
injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its
essential purpose.

on any such list. You also agree that you will not use these products
for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without
limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of

as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely
within California between California residents. This License shall not
be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
