//// VertxHelperBase

/**
   A base class for helper classes that use an embedded Vert.x core.
   This creates only one static Vert.x core that is accessible to its subclasses.
   It also keeps track of helpers that have been created for a particular
   actor, and provides a static method to obtain those helpers. Generally
   we will want no more than one such helper per actor. The references
   to the helpers are weak so that if the actor is garbage collected, the
   reference can be too.
   <p>
   This class also provides utilities for submitting jobs to be executed
   in an associated verticle.  This is useful for jobs that trigger future
   callbacks, because the verticle will ensure that all callbacks are called
   in the same thread.
   <p>
   Moreover, this class provides utilities for ensuring that a requested job
   has been completed, including all expected callbacks, before the next job
   is initiated. This is useful for ensuring that responses to requests
   occur in the same order as the requests themselves. To use this, when you
   make a request (e.g. using {@link #submit(Runnable)}, the subclass can
   call the protected method {@link #_setBusy(boolean)} with argument true,
   and subsequent requests will simply be queued until the subclass calls
   {@link #_setBusy(boolean)} with argument false.
   <p>
   This class also provides utilities for a subclass to issue asynchronous
   requests in order, and when callbacks occur, to execute those callbacks
   in the same order as the submitted requests. To use this, the subclass
   should assign consecutive increasing integers, starting with zero, to
   each request, and then wrap responses to that request in a Runnable
   and pass that Runnable to the protected method
   {@link #_issueOrDeferResponse(long, boolean, Runnable)}.
   That method will execute the Runnable only when all previous
   requests (ones with earlier sequence numbers) have had a response
   executed that indicated (with the second argument) that the request
   has been fully handled.
   This facility must be used with care: the subclass must ensure that
   every request results in at least one call to
   {@link #_issueOrDeferResponse(long, boolean, Runnable)}
   with the second argument being true; failing to do so will result in
   all future responses being queued and never executing.
   Using a timeout, for example, can ensure this.
   Note also that the specified Runnable will execute in the director
   thread (via a timeout mechanism with timeout equal to zero), not
   in the Verticle. Thus, subclasses that use should not directly invoke
   Vert.x functions that need to be run in the verticle in the Runnable
   that they pass. They should instead use {@link #submit(Runnable)}.
