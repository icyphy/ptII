<h1>The Distributed-SDF Domain Sleep Demo</h1>

The Sleep Demo illustrates the usage and advantages of the
Distributed-SDF domain.

<p> The model is an standard SDF Model with a Distributed-SDF
Director. Any non hierarchical SDF model can be simulated in a
distributed manner unless the actors have external dependencies.

<p>
<b>(Note that models that use actors that have GUI dependencies might
generate errors!)</b>

<p>
So try your own SDF models, you just change the standard SDF director
by the Distributed-SDF Director.

<p> By configuring the Distributed-SDF Director, we can choose to run
the model either sequential or parallel (default).
Make sure that the distributed platform is running before you start a
distributed simulation. To do this we provide a script under:

<dl>
<dt><B>Windows:</B>
<dd><code>$PTII/ptolemy/distributed/demo/Sleep/startplatform.bat</code>
<dt><B>Cygwin,Unix,Linux:</B>
<dd><code>$PTII/ptolemy/distributed/demo/Sleep/startplatform</code>
</dl>

This script starts the following services:
<UL>
<LI>Http daemon (on port 8080)
<LI>Reggie (a registration/lookup service using JINI)
<LI>5 DistributedSeverRMIGeneric servers (one for each actor in this
particular demo.)
</UL>

If you run the DOS batch file you will get 6 command windows, the
first for the first 2 services and the remaining 5 one for each
server. This allows you to follow each server individually.

<p>

We provide 3 more scripts under <I>$PTII/ptolemy/distributed/jini</I>:
<dl>

<dt><code>startjinilocal</code> and <code>startjinilocal.bat</code>
<dd>launches a local http server (daemon) and the reggie service
(registration and lookup service).

<dt><code>startserver</code> and <code>startserver.bat</code>
<dd>launches a starts a DistributedServerRMIGeneric server.
<dt><code>starttservers</code> and <code>starservers.bat</code>

<dd>launches a given number of DistributedServerRMIGeneric servers
depending on the parameter. (e.g. <code>startservers 5</code>
launches 5 servers).

</dl>

In order to illustrate the distributed simulation advantages to users
that have only access to a single machine this demo uses Sleep
actors. For every fire of the Sleep actors, they will stall for 5
seconds.  In a sequential simulation this means that a 10 seconds
stall is performed since the Sleep actors are executed one after the
other. In the case of parallel simulation, those two actors can stall
at the same time, reducing this time to 5 seconds for both.

<p>On the standard output for the model, you can check the execution time
for the simulation. Try to run both a sequential an a parallel
simulation and compare the times.

<p><B>(Note that the more iterations and the bigger the sleep times, the
more advantage you will get from using the distributed platform.)</B>

<p>For a more realistic demo, please run the individual servers on
different machines.

<p><B>(Note that if your network blocks broadcast packets you might
need to configure unicast locators.)</B>

<p>Look at the documentation of the Distributed-SDF Director in
particular and the classes and configuration files under
ptolemy.distributed for further information.

<h2>Problems</h2>
If, under Eclipse, you have security problems,then 
in Eclipse, go to Run -&gt; Open Run Dialog -&gt;
In the "Arguments" tab, enter the following line <b>including the double
quotes</b>.
<pre>
"-Djava.security.policy=${workspace_loc:ptII/bin/policy.all}"
</pre>
