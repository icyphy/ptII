    <div class="container-overview">
    
        
            <div class="description"><p>This accessor sends and/or receives messages from a TCP socket at
 the specified host and port. If the value of the <code>port</code> input is initially
 negative, then this accessor waits until it receives a non-negative <code>port</code>
 input before making a connection. Otherwise,
 upon initialization, it initiates a connection to the
 specified server. If at any time during execution it receives
 a 'port' input, then it will close any open socket and, if the new
 'port' value is non-negative, open
 a new socket to the current 'host' and 'port'.</p>
<p> When the connection is established, a <code>true</code> boolean is sent to
 the <code>connected</code> output. If the connection is broken during execution, then a <code>false</code>
 boolean is sent to the <code>connected</code> output. The swarmlet could respond to this by
 retrying to connect (send an event to either the <code>port</code> or <code>host</code> input).</p>
<p> Whenever an input is received on the <code>toSend</code> input,
 the data on that input is sent to the socket. If the socket is not yet open,
 this accessor will, by default, queue the message to send when a socket next opens,
 unless the <code>discardMessagesBeforeOpen</code> parameter is true, in which case,
 input messages that are received before the socket is opened will be
 discarded.</p>
<p> Whenever a message is received from the socket, that message is
 produced on the <code>received</code> output.</p>
<p> When <code>wrapup()</code> is invoked, this accessor closes the  connection.</p>
<p> The send and receive types can be any of those supported by the host.
 The list of supported types will be provided as options for the <code>sendType</code>
 and <code>receiveType</code> parameter. For the Ptolemy II host, these include at
 least 'string', 'number', 'image', and a variety of numeric types.</p>
<p> If both ends of the socket are known to be JavaScript clients,
 then you should use the 'number' data type for numeric data.
 If one end or the other is not JavaScript, then
 you can use more specified types such as 'float' or 'int', if they
 are supported by the host. In all cases, received numeric
 data will be converted to JavaScript 'number' when emitted.
 For sent data, this will try to convert a JavaScript number
 to the specified type. The type 'number' is equivalent
 to 'double'.</p>
<p> When type conversions are needed, e.g. when you send a double
 with <code>sendType</code> set to int, or an int with <code>sendType</code> set to byte,
 then a &quot;primitive narrowing conversion&quot; will be applied, as specified here:
 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3</a>.</p>
<p> For numeric types, you can also send an array all at once by providing an
 array to the <code>toSend</code> input port.
 The elements of the array will be sent in sequence all
 at once, and may be received in one batch. If both ends have
 <code>rawBytes</code> set to false (specifying message framing), then these
 elements will be emitted at the receiving end all at once in a single
 array. Otherwise, they will be emitted one at a time.</p>
<p> For strings, you can also send an array of strings in a single call,
 but these will be simply be concatenated and received as a single string.</p>
<p> If the <code>rawBytes</code> option is set to false, then each data item provided on <code>toSend</code>,
 of any type or array of types, will be coalesced into a single message and
 the receiving end (if it also has <code>rawBytes</code> set to false) will emit the entire
 message, and only the message, exactly once.  Otherwise, a message may get
 fragmented, emitted in pieces, or coalesced with subsequent messages.</p>
<p> When a model with an instance of this accessor stops executing, there
 are two mechanisms by which data in transit can be lost. In both cases, warning
 messages or error messages will be issued to the host to be displayed or otherwise
 handled as the host sees fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, there might be queued messages that were received on <code>toSend</code> but have not yet
been sent, either because the socket has not yet been opened or because
it was closed from the other side.</li>
<li>Second, a message might be received from the server after shutdown has commenced.
In particular, received messages are handled asynchronously by a handler function
that can be invoked at any time, and that handler might be invoked after it is no
longer possible for this accessor to produce outputs (it has entered its wrapup
phase of execution).</li>
</ul>
<p> The server might similarly lose messages by the same two mechanisms occurring
 on the server side. In that case, messages will presumably be displayed on the
 server side.</p>
<p> Accessors that extend this one can override the <code>toSendInputHandler</code> function
 to customize what is sent.</p>
<p> This accessor requires the 'socket' module.</p></div>
