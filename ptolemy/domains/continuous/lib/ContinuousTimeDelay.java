/**
 Delay the input by a specified amount of time.

 <p>This actor is designed
 to be used in timed domains such as DE and Continuous. It can also be used
 in other domains, such as SR and SDF, but this will only be useful if the
 delay value is a multiple of the period of those directors. The amount
 of the delay is required to be non-negative and has a default value 1.0.
 The input and output types are unconstrained, except that the output type
 must be the same as that of the input.
 <p>
 This actor keeps a local FIFO queue of all input events that may be requested
 by the director; an event expires and is removed from this queue if its
 timestamp is older than the current time less the delay. The behavior of this
 actor on each firing is to read a token from the input port (if present) and
 generates an output that is either equal to or an approximation of the delayed
 input signal. Output is absent if and only if no initial value is given and
 the actor is fired before input is received, or before the transient delay
 period has passed (i.e. model time is less than delay time).
 <p>
 Output is generated by the fire() method, and inputs are processed in postFire().
 <p>
 Occasionally, this actor is useful with the
 delay parameter set to 0.0.  The time stamp of the output will
 equal that of the input, but there is a "microstep" delay.
 The continuous domain in Ptolemy II has a "super dense" model
 of time, meaning that a signal from one actor to another can
 contain multiple events with the same time stamp. These events
 are "simultaneous," but nonetheless
 have a well-defined sequential ordering determined by the order
 in which they are produced.
 If \textit{delay} is 0.0, then the actor does not generate output
 in the current time microstep, but rather on a refiring at the
 the same physical time but incremented timestep.
 <p>
 A consequence of this strategy is that this actor is
 able to produce an output (or assert that there is no output) before the
 input with the same time is known.   Hence, it can be used to break
 causality loops in feedback systems. The Continuous director will leverage this when
 determining the fixed point behavior. It is sometimes useful to think
 of this zero-valued delay as an infinitesimal delay.
