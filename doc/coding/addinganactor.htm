    <h1>Adding An Actor to Ptolemy II</h1>
    Below are instructions for adding an actor to Ptolemy II
    and making it visible in Vergil.  
    <p>Chapter 5, "Designing Actors," of
      the Volume 1: Introduction to Ptolemy II of the
      Ptolemy II Design Document at
      <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/designdoc.htm#in_browser" target="_top"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/designdoc.htm</CODE></a>
      discusses how to design actors, but the design document does
      not discuss compiling the actor and adding it to Vergil.  The reason
      for this omission is because we are hoping to eventually have a cleaner
      method for adding actors.  The text below is a how-to guide for
      the current environment.</p>

    <h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

    Ptolemy II atomic actors are typically <code>.java</code> files
    that are compiled to <code>.class</code> files.  Ptolemy II
    composite actors are typically <code>.xml</code> files.  There are
    various ways to make both types of actors available, below is a
    list with pros and cons.

    <dl>
      <dt><a href="#InstantiateEntity">Instantiate Entity</a></dt>

      <dd>An atomic or composite actor that has been compiled to
	a <code>.class</code> file or a composite actor that is
	contained in a <code>.xml</code> file may be instantiated from
	Vergil via Graph -&gt; Instantiate Entity and used in the
	model.

	<br/><b>Pros:</b> Easy.  Instantiate an actor and use it in
	the model.  When the model is saved, the reference to the
	class is saved in the model.

	<br/><b>Cons:</b> Each time the modeler wants to use the
	actor, they must instantiate the actor, which means they need
	to know the name.  The <code>.class</code>
	or <code>.xml</code> file must be present in the CLASSPATH of
	the JVM when the model is opened.
	
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="#SaveActorInLibrary">User Library via Save Actor in Library</a></dt>

      <dd> Each user has a User Library,
	stored in <code>$HOME/.ptolemy/UserLibrary.xml</code>.  The
	user library is visible at the bottom of the actor palette.
	Once a class has been instantiated, to add it to the User
	Library right click on the actor and select "Save Actor in
	Library"
	
	<br/><b>Pros:</b> The custom actor appears in the User
	Library, so it is easy to browse available custom actors.

	<br/><b>Cons:</b> The modeler has to import each actor by
	hand.  This can be addressed by using "Import Library"

      </dd>

      <dt><a href="#ImportLibrary">Import Library</a></dt>
      <dd>In Vergil Graph -&gt; Import Library will import a file that lists custom actors.  
	This library can be saved in the User Library for more access in later Vergil sessions

	<br/><b>Pros:</b> An actor developer can create a file that lists custom actors
	and send it to a model builder.
	
	<br/><b>Cons:</b> The actor developer must also send a <code>.jar</code> file that
	includes the <code>.class</code> and/or <code>.xml</code> definitions of
	the custom actors.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="#CreatingAnImportLibraryGraphically">Creating an Import Library Graphically</a></dt>
      <dd>It is possible to create an library file graphically.
	<br/><b>Pros:</b> Same as <a href="#ImportLibrary">Import Library</a>.
	the library file can be created graphically instead of by hand.
	<br/><b>Cons:</b> Same as <a href="#ImportLibrary">Import Library</a>, 
	the steps are non-intuitive.
      </dd>

      <dt> <a href="#editing">Edit the configuration files</a></dt>
      <dd> Ptolemy II reads configuration files from <code>$PTII/ptolemy/configs</code>.
	A custom configuration can be created in that directory and invoked using a command-line
	option to <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code> or <code>ptolemy.vergil.VergilApplication</code>.
	
	<br/><b>Pros:</b> Creating a custom configuration gives the actor developer control
	over what actors are easily available to the model builder.  In this way, it is possible
	to hide or remove little-used, confusing or unused actors.

	<br/><b>Cons:</b> This method requires editing configuration <code>.xml</code> and possibly
	a custom Ptolemy II distribution for use by model builders.

    <p>The steps for creating a custom actor and adding it to the configuration are covered below.</p>


    
    <h2><a name="CreatingAnActor">Creating a Custom Atomic Actor and compiling it</a></h2>
    All of the methods above require a custom actor. 

    <p>The steps below cover creating a custom Atomic actor, which is the
      most common type of custom actor.  It is also possible to create a
      custom composite actor and use Actor Oriented Classes to make a
      custom composite actor, see
      <br/>Edward A. Lee, Xiaojun Liu, Stephen Neuendorffer.

    </p>

    <p>The first step to creating a custom atomic actor is to create
      a <code>.java</code> file and compile it, creating
      a <code>.class</code> file in the classpath.

    <p>Eclipse users should look at
      the <a href="../eclipse/index.htm">Eclipse Notes</a> page for
      "Instructions for adding an actor in Eclipse".</p>

    <p> For this example, we are going to take the Ramp actor
      and change the default step from <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>2</CODE>.
      The new actor will be called Ramp2.

    <p> The instructions below assume that you have installed
      the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the <CODE>javac</CODE>
      binary, that you have a <CODE>make</CODE> binary and other tools installed,
      that Ptolemy II has been installed, and that <CODE>$PTII/configure</CODE>
      and <CODE>make</CODE> have been run.  For details about the
      installation process, see
      <a href="../install.htm"><CODE>$PTII/doc/install.htm</CODE></a>
    <p>Under Windows Server 2008 R2  with Java 7 and Cygwin, to do the setup, I did:</p>
    <pre>
      export PTII=c:/Ptolemy/ptII9.0.devel
      cd "$PTII"
      ./configure
      make fast &gt;&amp; make.out
    </pre>
    <p>Configure and make usually generate a few warnings.</p>
    <p>An alternative is to use <a href="https://ant.apache.org/#in_browser" target="_top">Apache Ant</a>.
      Under Mac OS X 10.7, first install Ant, then download the Ptolemy II development tree:</p>
    <pre>
      cd
      svn co https://source.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn/chess/ptII/trunk ptII
      cd ptII
      export PTII=`pwd`
      cp build.default.xml build.xml
      ant
    </pre>
    <p>Below are the steps necessary to create the <code>.java</code> file for an actor and compile it:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Create the new <CODE>.java</CODE> file that implements your actor:
	<ol>
	  <li> In this case, we are just copying a <CODE>Ramp.java</CODE> to
	    <CODE>Ramp2.java</CODE>
	    <pre>
	      cd $PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib	
	      cp -p Ramp.java Ramp2.java
	    </pre>
	    Note that if we had copied our java code from a <i>different directory</i>,
	    we would also have to change the package
	    statement (usually near line 31) in the java code.
	    This is good to keep in mind since
	    there is no error message to clue you in to this particular error.<p>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li> Edit <CODE>Ramp2.java</CODE> and
	    <ul>
	      <li>Change: <pre>
		  public class Ramp extends SequenceSource {
		</pre>
		to:
		<pre>
		  public class Ramp<B>2</B> extends SequenceSource {
		</pre>
	      </li>
	      <li> Change:
		<pre>
		  public Ramp(CompositeEntity container, String name)
		  throws NameDuplicationException, IllegalActionException  {
		</pre>
		to:
		<pre>
		  public Ramp<B>2</B>(CompositeEntity container, String name)
		  throws NameDuplicationException, IllegalActionException  {
		</pre>
	      </li>
	      <li> Change:
		<pre>
		  step.setExpression("1");
		</pre>
		to:
		<pre>
		  step.setExpression("<B>2</B>");
		</pre>
	      </li>
	      <li> Change:
		<pre>
		  Ramp newObject = (Ramp)super.clone(workspace);
		</pre>
		to:
		<pre>
		  Ramp<B>2</B> newObject = (Ramp<B>2</B>)super.clone(workspace);
		</pre>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> If you are using <code>make</code> to build Ptolemy II, then the makefiles need to be updated.
	<br/>If you are using <code>ant</code>, then there is no need to update the makefiles for this example.
	<br/><i><code>make</code> users:</i> Edit the <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/makefile</CODE>
	and add <CODE>Ramp2.java</CODE> to the value of <CODE>JSRCS</CODE>.
	A good place for this is just after the <CODE>Ramp.java \</CODE>
	line:
	<pre>
	  Quantizer.java \
	  Ramp.java \
	  RandomSource.java \
	</pre>
	<pre>
	  Quantizer.java \
	  Ramp.java \
	  <B>Ramp2.java \</B>
	  RandomSource.java \
	</pre>
	Note that there is a <b>TAB</b> character before <code>Ramp2.java</code>.
	<br/>This step is not strictly necessary, but it is good programming
	practice to put all source files in the makefile.
	Another reason we add it to the makefile is so that our new actor
	will be included in the <CODE>lib.jar</CODE> file.
      </li>

      <li> <i><code>make</code> users:</i> Run <CODE>make</CODE> in the <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib</CODE>
	directory (which is where you should already be).  <CODE>make</CODE>
	will descend into the subdirectories and compile any needed files
	and eventually run
	<pre>
	  rm -f `basename Ramp2.java .java`.class
	  CLASSPATH="../../.." "/cygdrive/c/j2sdk1.4.2_06/bin/javac" -g -O Ramp2.java
	</pre>
	and <CODE>Ramp2.class</CODE> will be produced.
	<br/><i><code>ant</code> users:</i> Run
	<pre>
	  cd $PTII
	  ant
	</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>At this point, a class file at <code>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/Ramp2.class</code> will
      have been created.</p>

    <p>Below is a discussion of various ways to use that actor.</p>

    <h2><a name="InstantiateEntity">Instantiate Entity</a></h2>
    To instantiate an entity, follow these steps
    <ol>
      <li>Start up Vergil and do File -&gt; New -&gt; Graph Editor</li>
      <li>In Vergil, select Graph -&gt Instantiate Entity</li>
      <li>In the Instantiate Entity window, edit the Class name field and replace its contents with
	<code>ptolemy.actor.lib.Ramp2</code>
	<br/>Leave the Location (URL) field blank
	<br/>Hit OK
      </li>
      <li>The Ramp2 icon will appear.
      <li>  To test the Ramp2 actor:
	<ol>
	  <li> Click on <code>Actors</code> -&gt; <code>sinks</code> 
	    -&gt; <code>GenericSinks</code>
	    and drag a Display actor over to the main canvas.</li>

	  <li> Connect the two actors by left clicking on the output
	    of the ramp2 actor and dragging over to the input of the Display actor.</li>

	  <li> Select <code>Directors</code> -&gt; <code>SDF</code> and
	    drag the SDF director over to the right window.</li>

	  <li> Select <code>View</code> -&gt; <code>Run</code> and change the
	    number of iterations from <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>10</CODE>, then hit
	    the Run button.</li>

	  <li> You should see the numbers from 0 to 18 in the display.</li>

	</ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><b>Pros:</b> Easy.  Instantiate an actor and use it in the
      model.  When the model is saved, the reference to the class is
      saved in the model.</p>

    <p><b>Cons:</b> Each time the modeler wants to use the actor, they
      must instantiate the actor, which means they need to know the
      name.  The <code>.class</code> or <code>.xml</code> file must be
      present in the CLASSPATH of the JVM when the model is
      opened.</p>
    
    <p>A few notes about Instantiate Entity:</p>
    <p>Composite Actors can also be instantiated in this way.  For example
      <code>ptolemy.actor.lib.Sinewave</code> is an Actor Oriented Class definition
      of a composite actor.</p>
    <p>The Graph -&gt; Instantiate Attribute menu choice is used to instantiate Ptolemy Attributes
      such as parameters or Directors.</p>


    <h2><a name="SaveActorInLibrary">User Library via Save Actor in Library</a></h2>

    <p>Each user has a User Library, stored
      in <code>$HOME/.ptolemy/UserLibrary.xml</code>.</p>

    <p> In Vergil, the
      user library is visible at the bottom of the actor palette on the
      left.  Once a class has
      been <a href="#InstantiateEntity">instantiated</a>, to add it to
      the User Library right click on the actor and select "Save Actor
      in Library"</p>
    
    <p><b>Pros:</b> The custom actor appears in the User
      Library, so it is easy to browse available custom actors.</p>

    <p><b>Cons:</b> The modeler has to import each actor by
      hand.  This can be addressed by using "Import Library"</p>

    <p>The UserLibrary can be opened and organized just like a regular composite actor or a ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary can be used to provide a tree structure within the User Library.
	<br/>To add hierarchy to the User Library:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>In a Vergil graph editor, right click on UserLibrary and select Open for Editing</li>
	  <li>Instantiate an Entity Library by doing Graph -&gt; Instantiate Entity and then changing the Class name field to <code>ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary</code> and hitting OK</li>
	  <li>Optional: Change the name of the newly created EntityLibrary by right clicking on it</li>
	  <li>Open a new graph editor (File -&gt; New -&gt; Graph Editor) and click on the UserLibrary to see the new Entity Library</li>
	  <li>Right click on the new Entity Library and select Open for Editing to add actors</li>
	</ol>
	


    <h2><a name="ImportLibrary">Import Library</a></h2>

    <p>Ptolemy II uses <code>.xml</code> files that list one or more actors.  An actor developer
      can provide such a file to model developers.  
      <ol>
	<li>Create a file named <code>myactors.xml</code> with the contents below:
	  <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE class PUBLIC "-//UC Berkeley//DTD MoML 1//EN"
  "http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/dtd/MoML_1.dtd"&gt;
&lt;class name="MyActors" extends="ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary"&gt;
    &lt;configure&gt;
	&lt;group&gt;
            &lt;entity name="Ramp2" class="ptolemy.actor.lib.Ramp2"/&gt;
        &lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/configure&gt;
&lt;/class&gt;
	  </pre>
	</li>
	<li> Start up vergil, do File -&gt; New -&gt; Graph Editor</li>
	<li> Import <code>myactors.xml</code> with Graph -&gt; Import Library</li>
	<li> In the left hand actor pane, "MyActors" will appear at the bottom
      </ol>

      Currently, to add these files to the User Library, one must drag each in from the imported
      library into the User Library.
      <ol>
	<li> Import MyActors as above.</li>
	<li>In the left hand actor pane, right click on the UserLibrary and select Open for Editing.</li>
	<li> A new window will appear with UserLibrary.xml in the
	  title bar.  In that window open the MyActors palette and drag the Ramp2 actor into the main pane.
	  This will add the Ramp2 actor to UserLibrary.</li>
      </ol>

    <p><i>FIXME:</i> It would be nice if we could import the library directly into the User Library.</p>

    <p><b>Pros:</b> An actor developer can create a file that lists custom actors
      and send it to a model builder.</p>
    
    <p><b>Cons:</b> The actor developer must also send a <code>.jar</code> file that
      includes the <code>.class</code> and/or <code>.xml</code> definitions of
      the custom actors.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="CreatingAnImportLibraryGraphically">Creating an Import Library Graphically</a></h2>
    <p>It is possible to create an library file graphically instead of by hand as above
      in <a href="#ImportLibrary">Import Library</a>.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Follow the same procedure as above to create an EntityLibrary within the UserLibrary.
	<ol>
	  <li>In a Vergil graph editor, right click on UserLibrary and select Open for Editing.</li>
	  <li>Instantiate an Entity Library by doing Graph -&gt; Instantiate Entity and then changing the Class name field to <code>ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary</code> and hitting OK.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>Right click on the newly created EntityLibrary and select Convert To Class.  A blue border will be added, signifying that EntityLibrary is now an actor-oriented class.</li>
      <li>Right click on the EntityLibrary Class and select Open Actor.  The contents of the EntityLibrary class will open in a new window.</li>
      <li>In the EntityLibrary Class window, drag in or instantiate actors.</li>
      <li>In the EntityLibrary Class window, select File -&gt; Save As.  When the Save Submodel? window pops up, check the "Save Submodel only" box, hit ok and save the file.</li>
      <li>The saved file may now be import as per the <a href="#ImportLibrary">Import Library</a> procedure above.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Pros:</b> Same as <a href="#ImportLibrary">Import Library</a>,
        the library file can be created graphically instead of by hand.</p>
    <p><b>Cons:</b> Same as <a href="#ImportLibrary">Import Library</a>, 
	the steps are non-intuitive.</p>


    <h2><a name="editing">Editing the configuration files</a></h2>
    <p>Ptolemy II reads configuration files from <code>$PTII/ptolemy/configs</code>.
      A custom configuration can be created in that directory and invoked using a command-line
      option to <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code> or <code>ptolemy.vergil.VergilApplication</code>.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li> There are many ways to make a custom actor permanently available.  One way is to edit
	the Ptolemy II configuration.  This method is best if only one person is using Ptolemy II.
	A downside is that an update of Ptolemy II will require readding the actor. 
	<br/>An upside is that it is easy.
	<br/>Edit <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/sequencesources.xml</CODE>
	and add Ramp2 just after the lines for Ramp
	<br>Change:
	<pre>
&lt;entity name="Ramp" class="ptolemy.actor.lib.Ramp"&gt;
    &lt;doc&gt;Create a sequence of tokens with increasing value&lt;/doc&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;

&lt;entity name="Sinewave" class="ptolemy.actor.lib.Sinewave"/&gt;
	</pre>
	To:
	<pre>
&lt;entity name="Ramp" class="ptolemy.actor.lib.Ramp"&gt;
    &lt;doc&gt;Create a sequence of tokens with increasing value&lt;/doc&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;

<B>&lt;entity name="Ramp2" class="ptolemy.actor.lib.Ramp2"&gt;
    &lt;doc&gt;Create a sequence of tokens with increasing value 2&lt;/doc&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
</B>

&lt;entity name="Sinewave" class="ptolemy.actor.lib.Sinewave"/&gt;
	</pre>
      </li>

      <li> Start up Vergil and click on File -&gt; New -&gt; Graph Editor</li>
      <li> In the Graph Editor window, click on Actors -&gt; Sources -&gt; SequenceSources
	<br/The Ramp2 actor will appear.</li>

		</ol>

    <p><b>Pros:</b> Creating a custom configuration gives the actor developer control
      over what actors are easily available to the model builder.  In this way, it is possible
      to hide or remove little-used, confusing or unused actors.</p>

    <p><b>Cons:</b> This method requires editing configuration <code>.xml</code> and possibly
      a custom Ptolemy II distribution for use by model builders.</p>

    <h2><a name="AddingANewPalette">Adding a new palette</a></h2>

    <p>To add a new set of actors, we first create a .xml file
      that lists the actor.  In this case, the file
      is called <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/myactors.xml</CODE>,
      and it contains one actor, <CODE>Ramp2</CODE>:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE plot PUBLIC "-//UC Berkeley//DTD MoML 1//EN"
  "http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/dtd/MoML_1.dtd"&gt;
&lt;entity name="myactors" class="ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary"&gt;
    &lt;configure&gt;
        &lt;?moml
           &lt;group&gt;
               &lt;doc&gt;My Actors&lt;/doc&gt;
               &lt;entity name="Ramp2" class="ptolemy.actor.lib.Ramp2"&gt;
                   &lt;doc&gt;Create a sequence of tokens with increasing value of 2&lt;/doc&gt;
               &lt;/entity&gt;
           &lt;/group&gt;
         ?&gt;
    &lt;/configure&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Note that the xml involving the Ramp2 actor is inside a &lt;configure&gt;...&lt;configure&gt; 
      block, which prevents the actor from being instantiated until the file is viewed in the actor palette.</p>


    <p>Below we discuss two ways of adding the configuration:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#AddingAPaletteToTheUserConfiguration">Adding a palette to the user configuration</a>
	<br>Easier to do, works with the Windows installer version,
	makes your new palette visible in all configurations</li>

      <li><a href="#AddingAPaletteToTheDefaultConfiguration">Adding a palette to the default configuration</a>
	Adding a palette to the default configuration
	<br>Harder to do, but useful for developers</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="AddingAPaletteToTheUserConfiguration">Adding a palette to the user configuration</a></h3>
    When vergil starts up, it opens the user library, which is located
    at <code>$HOME/.ptolemyII/UserLibrary</code>.

    <p>Under Windows 7, <code>$HOME</CODE> might be found at
      <code>c:/Users/<i>yourlogin</i></code>, so
      the UserLibrary.xml file would be at
      <code>c:/Users/<i>yourlogin</i>/.ptolemyII/UserLibrary.xml</code></p>
    <p>Edit UserLibrary.xml and change:</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;entity name="UserLibrary" class="ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary"/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>to:</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;entity name="UserLibrary" class="ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary"&gt;
      &lt;group&gt;
      &lt;input source="ptolemy/actor/lib/myactors.xml"/&gt;
      &lt;/group&gt;
      &lt;/entity&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>Note that you must remove the slash in the first line:</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;entity name="UserLibrary" class="ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary"<b>/</b>&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>becomes:</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;entity name="UserLibrary" class="ptolemy.moml.EntityLibrary"&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>After changing UserLibrary.xml, restart vergil and the myactors
      sub-palette will appear under UserLibrary.</p>

    <h3><a name="AddingAPaletteToTheDefaultConfiguration">Adding a palette to the default configuration</a></h3>
    <p>The palette on the left side of the Graph editor lists the utilities,
      directors and actors available for use in Vergil.</p>

    <p>The palette and menus are determined by configuration files.</p>

    <p>The default configuration for <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code> is located at
      <a href="../../ptolemy/configs/full/configuration.xml"><CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/configs/full/configuration.xml</CODE></a>.
      (For further information about how the configuration is specified, see the
      <a href="../codeDoc/ptolemy/vergil/VergilApplication.html">VergilApplication
	class documentation</a>.)</p>

    <p><a href="../../ptolemy/configs/full/configuration.xml"><CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/configs/full/configuration.xml</CODE></a>.  
      includes
      <a href="../../ptolemy/configs/defaultFullConfiguration.xml"><CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/configs/defaultFullConfiguration.xml</CODE></a>.  
      Eventually, we include
      <a href="../../ptolemy/configs/basicActorLibrary.xml"><CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/configs/basicActorLibrary.xml</CODE></a>.</p>

    <p>We want to add our new palette, <code>myactors.xml</code>,
      to the actor library palette so we will add <code>myactors.xml</code> to
      <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/configs/basicActorLibrary.xml</CODE>.
      Note that we want our new palette to be a sub pallet of the actor
      library palette, just as the sources palette is.  The
      <CODE>input</CODE> statements below do not cause the palette
      named by the <code>source</code> parameter
      to be a sub palette.  Sub-paletting is caused by the
      <CODE>entity</CODE> statement in the 4th line of your myactors.xml
      file.</p>

    <p>In <CODE>ptolemy/configs/basicActorLibrary.xml</CODE> we change</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;input source="ptolemy/actor/lib/sources.xml"/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>to:</p>
    <pre>
      <b>&lt;input source="ptolemy/actor/lib/myactors.xml"/&gt;</b>
      &lt;input source="ptolemy/actor/lib/sources.xml"/&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Then restart vergil, and your myactors sub-palette will appear under
      'actor library'.</p>

    <h3><a name="AddingToTheClasspath">Adding to the Java Classpath</a></h3>
    <p>We consider two cases where you would like to make a custom actor available:</p>
    <ol>

      <li>If your custom actor has is based on a .java file, then the
	user must make your custom actor's .class file visible to the
	Ptolemy II runtime.</li>

      <li>If your custom actor is defined in a .xml or .moml file, then the user must make
	your custom actor's .xml or .moml file visible to the Ptolemy II runtime.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Both situations involve the user making files visible to the Ptolemy II runtime by
      placing files in a location where the Ptolemy II runtime will find the files.  In Java,
      this is know as "Adding a file to the classpath.".  For details about the classpath, see the
      <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html#in_browser" target="_top">Java Tutorial PATH and CLASSPATH page</a></p>

    <p>A few things to keep in mind about the Java classpath:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If java is invoked with <code>-classpath</code> or <code>-cp</code>, then
	the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable is <b>not read</b>.</li>
      <li>Under Window Cygwin, Java does not understand paths like <code>/cygdrive/c/Ptolemy/ptII</code>.
	Instead, use <code>c:/Ptolemy/ptII</code>.</li>
      <li>Java 1.6 and later handle wildcards in the classpath.  If the classpath ends in <code>*</code>
	then that directory is searched for files that end in <code>.jar</code> and <code>.JAR</code>.
	(However, under Mac OS X with Java 1.6.0_31, Java classpath wildcards seem not to work, see <a href="#MacVergilApp">below</a>).
      <li>From within vergil, to check the classpath, do: 
	<ol>
	  <li> File -&gt; New -&gt Graph Editor</li>
	  <li> View -&gt; JVM Properties</li>
	  <li> Then look for the <code>java.class.path</code> property.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ptolemy II is available on several platforms and can be built in various ways.  Below is a list
      of possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="#WindowsVergilExe">Installed from the Windows Installer, invoked using <code>vergil.exe</code></a></li>
	  <li><a href="#WindowsVergilBat">Built using ./configure or Ant, invoked using <code>$PTII/bin/vergil.bat</code></a></li>
	  <li><a href="#VergilShellScript">Built using ./configure or Ant, invoked using <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code></a></li>

	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Linux/Unix/Mac OS X
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="#VergilShellScript">Built using ./configure or Ant, invoked using <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code></a></li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>Mac OS X
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="#MacVergilApp">Macintosh, invoked using <code>$PTII/bin/Vergil.app</code></a></li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a name="WindowsVergilExe">Installed from the Windows Installer, invoked using <code>vergil.exe</code></a></h4>
    <p>The Windows <code>vergil.exe</code> is what gets invoked with the user installs Ptolemy II via
      the Windows installer and then invokes Ptolemy via the Windows Start Menu.</p>

    <p>The <code>vergil.exe</code> binary is created
      using <a href="http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/#in_browser" target="_top">launch4j</a>.
      When the installer is being built, a list of directories in
      which to search are passed to launch4j and then encoded
      in <code>vergil.exe</code>.  A list of these directories may be found in <code>$PTII/bin/mkl4j</code>.</p>

    <p>As of May, 2012, the directories that are searched by <code>vergil.exe</code>:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>%HOMEPATH%/.ptolemyII</code></dt>
      <dd>Any .class files in this directory or any subdirectories</dd>
      <dt><code>%HOMEPATH%/.ptolemyII/*</code></dt>
      <dd>Any .jar or .JAR files in this directory</dd>

      <dt><code>%HOME%/.ptolemyII</code></dt>
      <dd>Any .class files in this directory or any subdirectories</dd>
      <dt><code>%HOME%/.ptolemyII/*</code></dt>
      <dd>Any .jar or .JAR files in this directory</dd>
      <dt><code>contrib/contrib.jar</code></dt>
      <dd>The <code>contrib/contrib.jar</code> file in the directory
	where <code>vergil.exe</code> is invoked.  Typically, this
	is <code>c:\Ptolemy\ptII<i>N.M</i></code>,
	here <code><i>N.M</i></code> is the release number.</dd>
      <dt><code>$ROOT</code></dt>
      <dd>The directory where <code>vergil.exe</code> is invoked.
	Typically, this is <code>c:\Ptolemy\ptII<i>N.M</i></code>,
	here <code><i>N.M</i></code> is the release number.</dd>
      <dt><i>other jar files .  .  . </i></dt>
      <dd>Other jar files in the Ptolemy II release</dd>
    </dl>			     

    <p>Under Windows <code>%HOMEPATH%</code> is set to various
      locations depending on the version of Windows,
      see <a href="http://www.askvg.com/list-of-environment-variables-in-windows-xp-vista-and-7/#in_browser" target="_top">http://www.askvg.com/list-of-environment-variables-in-windows-xp-vista-and-7/</a>.
      Under Windows 7, <code>%HOMEPATH%</code> is
      typically <code>C:\Users\<i>username</i></code>.</p>

    <p>Under Windows <code>%HOME%</code> is not set by default, but
      since some Cygwin applications use it, <code>%HOME%</code> may
      be set in your environment.</p>

    <p>So, under Windows when invoking <code>vergil.exe</code> if you
      have .class files, then adding them to
      either <code>%HOMEPATH%/.ptolemyII</code>
      or <code>%HOME%/.ptolemyII</code> or to the location where Ptolemy
      is installed is a good bet.</p>

    <p>If you have .jar files, then place them in either <code>%HOMEPATH%/.ptolemyII</code> or <code>%HOME%/.ptolemyII</code> or replace contrib.jar with your jar file.</p>


    <h4><a name="WindowsVergilBat">Built using ./configure or Ant, invoked using <code>$PTII/bin/vergil.bat</code></a></h4>

    <p>The <code>$PTII/bin/vergil.bat</code> DOS batch file is created by running <code>make</code>
      in <code>$PTII/bin</code>.  The <code>vergil.bat</code> file looks in the directories listed 
      for <code>vergil.exe</code>.</p>

    <h4><a name="VergilShellScript">Built using ./configure or Ant, invoked using <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code></a></h4>

    <p>The <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code> shell script is a symbolic
      link to <code>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke</code>.
      The <code>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke</code> script is created from
      the <code>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke.in</code>, which is in turn created
      by running <code>configure</code> in <code>$PTII</code>.</p>
    <p>To update <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code>:</p>
    <pre>
      cd $PTII
      ./configure
      cd $PTII/bin
      make
    </pre>

    <p>The <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code> shell script can be run from
    any platform where Ptolemy II has been built from sources.  The
    Windows installer <b>does not</b> include a
    working <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code> file.</p>

    <p>The <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code> script searches from the same
      directories as <code>vergil.exe</code> above,
      except <code>%HOMEPATH%/.ptolemyII</code>
      and <code>%HOMEPATH/.ptolemyII/*</code> are <b>not</b>
      searched.</p>

    <h4><a name="MacVergilApp">Macintosh, invoked using <code>$PTII/bin/Vergil.app</code></a></h4>
    <p>Under Mac OS X, the <code>$PTII/bin/Vergil.app</code> script is created by invoking 
      <code>$PTII/bin/makeapp</code>, which is a symbolic
      link to <code>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke</code>.
      The <code>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke</code> script is created from
      the <code>$PTII/bin/ptinvoke.in</code>, which is in turn created
      by running <code>configure</code> in <code>$PTII</code>.</p>
    <p>To update <code>$PTII/bin/Vergil.app</code>:</p>
    <pre>
      cd $PTII
      ./configure
      cd $PTII/bin
      make
    </pre>

    <p><code>$PTII/bin/Vergil.app</code> is a directory that is contains
      <code>bin/Vergil.app/Contents/Info.plist</code> which is the file that is created by running
      <code>$PTII/bin/makeapp</code>.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Mac OS X Java 1.6.0_31-b04-415-11M3635 does not seem to support Java wildcard paths
      like <code>$HOME/.ptolemyII/*</code>.  The workaround is to open
      <code>$PTII/bin/Vergil.app/Contents/Info.plist</code> with an editor and add the .jar files by hand.</p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In the above, we have shown various ways of including user defined custom actors in Ptolemy II.</p>
