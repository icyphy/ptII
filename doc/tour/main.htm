    Ptolemy II can be used to build sophisticated application domain-specific modeling capabilities
    and frameworks. These frameworks can be packaged as separate executable
    applications (e.g. HyVisual or VisualSense)
    or accessed from within Ptolemy II. Here, we illustrate some such frameworks.

	<br/> The wireless domain in Ptolemy II
	provides discrete-event modeling of wireless communication systems.
	It is useful for modeling and design of communication protocols,
	networking strategies, and applications such as sensor networks.
	The

	<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/visualsense/#in_browser" target="_top">VisualSense</a>

	plus domains that support the design of nodes in a wireless network.
	The 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/wireless/demo/WirelessSoundDetection/WirelessSoundDetection.htm">WirelessSoundDetection</a>
	example models a sound localization problem, where single sound source
	moves through a field of sound sensors. In the example, sound sensors detect the sound
	and communicate via a radio channel to a sensor fusion component that
	localizes the sound by triangulation. Two distinct channel models are used,
	one that models sound propagation and one that models radio communication.

	Ptolemy II includes an extensive library and models of computation suitable for
	digital signal processing, communication systems design, and image and video processing.
	The 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/MaximumEntropySpectrum/MaximumEntropySpectrum.htm">MaximumEntropySpectrum</a>

	example shows spectral estimation of sinusoids in noise.
	It illustrates models the use of synchronous dataflow (SDF) for signal

	hierarchical models,
	the Expression actor, and the signal processing actor library.


    </ul>
    <h2>
      <a name="heterogeneous">Heterogeneous Models</a>
    </h2>
    A particular capability of Ptolemy II is the ability to mix models of computation.
    These examples illustrate some of these capabilities.
    <ul>

      <li><i>Modal Models</i>:

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/ModalModel/ModalModel.htm">ModalModel</a>

	<br/>
	A modal model is one whose behavior depends on its "mode"
	of operation. A modal model in Ptolemy II heterogeneously combines the
	<i>finite state machine</i> (FSM) domain
	combined hierarchically with other models. A state in the FSM represents
	a mode of operation, and can have a refinement that gives the behavior
	in that mode.
	The refinement can be another FSM or some other model using some other
	Ptolemy domain. The 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/ModalModel/ModalModel.htm">ModalModel</a>
	example combines DE, FSM, and SDF to model a
	system where regularly sampled signals are perturbed by irregular
	events in time.

	(see also

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Switch/Switch.htm">Switching Continuous</a>
	)
	<br/>
	This example shows how to combine continuous-time modeling
	with discrete-event modeling to get mixed-signal modeling.
	The example models a MEMS accelerometer where a digital circuit
	implements feedback control and A/D conversion (a design due to
	Mark Lemkin).

    </ul>
    <h2>
      <a name="basic">Basic Modeling Capabilities</a>
    </h2>
    Many common models of computation have been implemented in
    Ptolemy II.  This section illustrates some of them.
    <ul>

      <li><i>Synchronous Dataflow</i>:

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Spectrum/Spectrum.htm">Spectrum</a>
	(See also

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/MaximumEntropySpectrum/MaximumEntropySpectrum.htm">MaximumEntropySpectrum</a>

	<!-- , and
	     a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/SoundSpectrum/SoundSpectrum.htm" SoundSpectrum/a -->
	)
	<br/> This example shows simple spectral estimation of the product
	of two sinusoids in noise.  It illustrates models the use of synchronous dataflow (SDF) for signal
	processing, and also shows many basic capabilities like
	hierarchical models,
	the Expression actor, and the signal processing actor library.
	In SDF, the firing of actors is statically scheduled, and at the start of execution,
	boundedness and deadlock conditions are checked.


	<br/>

      <li><i>Continuous-Time Modeling</i>:

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Lorenz/Lorenz.htm">Lorenz</a>
	(see also

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/SquareWave/SquareWave.htm">SquareWave</a>
	)
	<br/> This example shows a continuous-time
	nonlinear feedback system that exhibits
	chaotic behavior (this system is called a Lorenz attractor).
	It illustrates the <i>continuous-time</i> (CT) domain,
	which uses an underlying solver for ordinary differential equations.


	<br/>

      <li><i>Discrete-Event Modeling</i>:

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/Inspection/Inspection.htm">Inspection</a>
	(see also

	<a href="../../ptolemy/data/type/demo/Router/Router.htm">Router</a>

	and 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/TimingParadox/TimingParadox.htm">TimingParadox</a>
	).
	<br/> This example shows
	a famous paradox in probability called the inspection paradox.
	It illustrates use of the <i>discrete-event</i> (DE) domain, where
	events occur on a time line and are processed chronologically.
	In this example, random
	data stimulates a model and statistics are collected and reported
	in various ways.


	<br/>

      <li><i>Process Networks</i>:

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/OrderedMerge/OrderedMerge.htm">OrderedMerge</a>
	(see also

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/NondeterministicMerge/NondeterministicMerge.htm">NondeterministicMerge</a>
	,

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/QR/QR.htm">QR</a>
	).
	<br/>
	The process networks (PN) domain follows the semantics given by Kahn and MacQueen in 1977
	to get processes with their own threads of control that send messages to one another
	and achieve deterministic computation.
	The 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/OrderedMerge/OrderedMerge.htm">OrderedMerge</a>
	example implements an example given by Kahn and MacQueen
	that calculates numbers whose prime
	factors are 2, 3, and 5, only, and produces
	them in an ordered sequence.
	As of version 5.0, we have extended this model of computation with a
	nondeterministic merge actor, illustrated in

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/NondeterministicMerge/NondeterministicMerge.htm">NondeterministicMerge</a>
	.

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/RandomWalk/RandomWalk.htm">RandomWalk</a>
	)
	<br/>
	In dynamic dataflow (DDF) models, actors are fired in response to available
	input data. The schedule is dynamic and data dependent, and actors can
	change their production and consumption rates in each firing.
	Unlike synchronous dataflow, the DDF model of computation is Turing
	complete, and questions of deadlock and boundedness are undecidable.
	The 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/HanoiTower/HanoiTower.htm">HanoiTower</a>

	example exploits this to give an algorithmic solution to the well-known
	towers of Hanoi problem.

	<br/>
      <li> <i>Heterochronous Dataflow</i>:

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Fibonacci/Fibonacci.htm">Fibonacci</a>

	(see also

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Merge/Merge.htm">Merge</a>
	).
	<br/>
	Heterochronous dataflow (HDF) is an extension of synchronous dataflow
	(SDF) that permits dynamically changing production and consumption
	patterns without sacrificing static scheduling. In SDF, the production
	and consumption patterns of an actor are constant.
	In HDF they are allowed to change between iterations of the HDF schedule.
	Modal models can be used to change these patterns.
	Although HDF can express many data-dependent computations that cannot
	be represented by SDF, it is not Turing complete.  Consequently, deadlock
	and boundedness remain decidable.
	The 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Fibonacci/Fibonacci.htm">Fibonacci</a>

	example uses this mechanism in a clever way to extract a Fibonacci sequence
	from a counting sequence.

	(see also

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sr/demo/GuardedCount/GuardedCount.htm">GuardedCount</a>
	).
	<br/>
	The synchronous/reactive (SR) domain,
	which is inspired by the synchronous languages Esterel, Lustre, and Signal,
	realizes a concurrency model where actors react instantaneously and simultaneously
	at ticks of a logical clock.
	The 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sr/demo/TokenRing/TokenRing.htm">TokenRing</a>

	example uses the fixed-point semantics of SR to arbitrate access
	to a shared medium using a token-ring protocol.

    <h2>
      <a name="infrastructure">Modeling Infrastructure</a>
    </h2>
    Ptolemy II models are built on an underlying framework that provides a rich
    set of generic capabilities that are available in all models.
    This section illustrates that infrastructure.
    <ul>

      <li><i>The Type System</i>:

	<a href="../../ptolemy/data/type/demo/Router/Router.htm">Router</a>
	.
	<br/>
	This model illustrates the very sophisticated type system
	of Ptolemy II, where type constraints propagate transparently,
	actors are polymorphic, and composite types such as records and
	arrays are supported.
	This example illustrates composite types, where records are
	constructed out of tokens with various types. Here, a record
	models a packet in a packet-switched network, where variable
	delays may result in out-of-order arrival of packets.

	<br/>

      <li><i>Expression Language</i>:

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Transmission/Transmission.htm">Transmission</a>
	.
	<br/>
	To simplify creating new components, Ptolemy II contains a functional
	expression language.  The expression language is integrated with the
	type system, allowing static type checking of polymorphic expressions
	with few type annotations.  The expression language also allows new,
	encapsulated functions, called function closures, to be defined and
	passed as data.  This model illustrates how function closures can be
	used to make models much more compact.

	<!--/vergilDocs-->

	<br/>Higher-order components are components that operate on components.
	The 
	<a href="../../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/HocDE/HocDE.htm">HocDE</a>

	example contains a component that is a composite actor that
	replicates itself some specified number of times to operate on
	multiple channels of input.  This capability was created by
	Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, Research In Motion, Ltd.

	<br/>
	This model illustrates the use of plotter to provide input
	as well as rendering output from a model.  Right click and drag
	on the plot to trace out a new signal. The model runs each time you
	do this.

	<br/>

	<!-- No Matlab Applets -->
      <li><i>Matlab Integration</i>:
	Ptolemy II include  the Matlab interface created by
	Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, of Research in Motion Ltd.,
	to plot a 3-D surface. The Matlab interface requires that Matlab
	be installed locally and because it uses JNI it requires signed

	(see also

	<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/RijndaelEncryption/RijndaelEncryption.htm">Rijndael Encryption</a>
	).
	<br/>
	Actor-oriented classes, subclasses, and
	inner classes with inheritance are a special feature of Ptolemy II.
	They provide modularity mechanisms analogous to those of object-oriented
	design, but adapted to actor-oriented design. This capability permits, for
	example, defining a class of models that can have instances and subclasses.
	The instances and subclasses inherit all the features of the class, and
	track any changes that are made to the class.

	<br/>
	This model illustrates the use of the statically
	checked units system. A unit system
	defines a set of interrelated dimensions and measures. For example, in
	the time dimension, we might have seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
	and fortnights. Ptolemy II includes two experimental units systems,
	one that is statically checked and one that is dynamically checked.

	This example illustrates that models may be defined in a networked,
	distributed fashion.
	This model contains a component that is defined on the Ptolemy project
	website.  When you open the model, you will be alerted to the fact
	that it requires loading a model definition from a remote source.
	If you agree to proceed, then you will have a model with a remotely

	Ptolemy II includes actors that interface to the audio system on
	the executing machine, assuming it has one.
	This example shows the Karplus-Strong algorithm, which synthesizes
	a musical sound that closely resembles a plucked string instrument.
	It illustrates the audio capabilities of Ptolemy II.

	<br/>

      <li><i>Python Integration</i>:
	<br/>Python is a popular interpreted programming language that has
	been integrated into Ptolemy II using the jython Java implementation of Python.
	However, Python creates cache files on the local hard drive,
	so we have no applets illustrating the interface.
	<!--
	    This example shows that use of Python to alter a string entered by the user
	    to modify any word that begins with "t" so that it begins with "pt".
	    This leverages the excellent string processing capabilities in Python.
	    Python can also be used to prototype
	    actors by defining their functionality in Python.

    <h2>
      <a name="experimental">Experimental Capabililties</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ptolemy II has a number of less well-developed experimental
      capabilities that may continue to evolve over time.
      These are illustrated in the following examples.

      <ul>

	<li> 
	  <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ci/demo/Router/Router.htm">Push/Pull Component Interaction</a>
	  .
	  <br/>
	  The CI (component interaction) domain models communication between
	  components that uses a combination of push and pull. This model
	  illustrates the use of these styles of communication to route packets
	  through queues using some policy that depends on the queue sizes.

	  <br/>

	<li>Cal: an interpreted actor definition language.
	  At this time, there are no Cal applets.

	  <br/>

	<li>
	  <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/dt/demo/Eye/Eye.htm">Discrete-Time Models</a>
	  .
	  <br/> This example shows a simple pulse-amplitude modulation, physical
	  layer communication system.  It illustrates the <i>discrete-time</i> (DT)
	  domain, live parameter editing and
	  the scope-style plotter (which shows an eye diagram).
	  Note that discrete-time models can also be represented using the
	  SDF domain, which is not explicit about the passage of time.

	  <br/>

	<li> 
	  <a href="../../ptolemy/../doc/codegen.htm">Code Generation</a>

	  <br/>
	  This release includes a limited prototype of our code generation facility
	  that will generate .class files for non-hierarchical SDF models.
	  This example leads to more information about this capability.

	  <br/>

	<li>
	  <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/tm/demo/Controllers/Controllers.htm">Timed Multitasking</a>
	  .<br/>
	  This example illustrates the <i>timed multitasking</i> (TM) domain,
	  which is inspired by the Giotto language, and has features of
	  priority-driven real-time operating systems. In this example,
	  two control systems share a computational resource. Depending
	  on the scheduling strategy chosen (preemptive or nonpreemptive)
	  and the priorities, the two control systems may be both stable,
	  or one may be stable, or the other may be stable.
