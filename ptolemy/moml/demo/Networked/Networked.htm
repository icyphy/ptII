This model contains a component that is defined on the Ptolemy project
website.  When you open the model, you will be alerted to the fact
that it requires loading a model definition from a remote source.
If you agree to proceed, then you will have a model with a remotely
defined component.  The component itself is at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml">
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml</a>.
You can open that definition by clicking on the hyperlink, or by
using the "Open URL" command in the File menu.
 <p>
This applet will only work if this HTML file
resides on the <CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE>
web server.
The reason is that the default applet security policy
only permits connections to the machine where the applet originated.
Thus, if this applet is on your local machine, you will get a
SecurityException when the applet tries to connect to
<CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE> to download part of 
the model.
 <br>This restriction applies only to running this model as an applet,
the model will run without this restriction under vergil or Web Start.

<P>
The <a href="NetworkedVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
