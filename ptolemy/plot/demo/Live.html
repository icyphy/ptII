<h1>Live, Animated Plot</h1>
<hr>
The following plot illustrates a dynamically updated plot:
<p>
<applet name="Live" code="ptplot.demo.PlotLiveDemoApplet" width=400 height=400
    codebase="../.."
    archive="ptplot/ptplot.zip"
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."
>
<param name="background" value="faf0e6">
   <hr>If your browser recognized the applet tag,
    you would see an applet here.<hr>
</applet>
<p>
Click on the start button to start the plotting, and on the stop button to stop it.  The animation on this plot has been slowed down for visual
aesthetics.
On a reasonable computer, plotting is quite fast.
<p>
Such a plot is created by defining a class derived from <code>PlotLive</code>
(which is abstract).  The example shown here is the
<a href="PlotLiveDemo.java">PlotLiveDemo</a> class.
It defines only two methods, <code>init()</code> and <code>run()</code>.
The first of these sets static properties of the plot (title, labels, etc.)
while the second defines the body of a thread that generates points forever (if it is
allowed to).
<p>

There are still some problems with <code>PlotLive</code>.  The most
annoying is that this class uses the "exclusive or" drawing mode to
allow it to easily erase old points as it adds new ones.  This mode,
however, introduces a number of annoying artifacts in the graph.  In
particular, if marks are made at the plotted points, and lines are
drawn between points, the lines effectively erase the marks where they
intersect.  Moreover, if lines or points overlap, they erase each
other.  In the future we hope to replace this mechanism with one that
treats marks on the screen as graphical objects.
