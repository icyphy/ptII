    <h1>Mac OS X: Installing Java</h1>

    For Mac OS X, Java is already installed, but Ptolemy II requires Java 1.6, so we must
    check the Java version.

    <h2>Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)</h2>
    <p>Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) has only Java 1.6 and later, so there is nothing further to be done.</p>
    <p>To determine which version of the operating system is running, click on the apple icon in
      the upper left and select "About this Mac".</p>

    <p>If you are running "Mac OS X 10.7" or later, then <a href="eclipse.htm">go to the next step</a>.</p>

    <h2>Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and earlier</h2>
    <p>If you are running Mac OS 10.6 or earlier, then read on and verify that Java 1.6
      is the default version.

    <p>See <a href="../../install.htm">Ptolemy II Installation</a> for details, but
      briefly:</p>
    <p>Ptolemy II requires Java 1.6 because ptdb uses javax.swing.GroupLayout.
      Also, Java 1.5 is past its end of life.</p>

    <p>To determine which version of Java is being run, start up a Terminal window
      by going to Application -> Utilities and clicking on the Terminal icon.</p>

    <p>Then type:</p>
    <pre>
      java -version
    </pre>
    <p>If you are running Java 1.6 or later, then <a href="eclipse.htm">go to the next step</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are running Java 1.5, then you are probably using Mac OS 10.5.  We recommend
      using the 32-bit version of Java, which is handled in the
      <a href="eclipse.htm">next step</a>.</p>
