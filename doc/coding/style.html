<h1>Programming Style for Ptolemy II</h1>
<p>
The following programming style will be followed in the Ptolemy II project.
Please submit comments or suggestions to eal@eecs.berkeley.edu.
<ol>
<li><a href="#indentation">Indentation</a>
<li><a href="#comment conventions">Comment conventions</a>
<li><a href="#naming conventions">Naming conventions</a>
<li><a href="#global variables">Global variables</a>

</ol>

<h2><a name="indentation">Indentation</a></h2>

Tabs are 8 characters.  Do not override this in your text editor.
Nested statements should be indented 4 characters, as in:
<pre>
public class NamedObj implements Nameable, Serializable, Cloneable {

    /** Construct an object in the default workspace with an empty string
     *  as its name. The object is added to the list of objects in
     *  the workspace. Increment the version number of the workspace.
     */
    public NamedObj() {
        this(_defaultworkspace, "");
    }
</pre>
Closing brackets should be on a line by themselves, aligned with
the beginning of the line that contains the open bracket.
<p>
Long lines (which are common, especially for Tk commands)
should be broken up into many small lines.  Continuation lines
are indented by 8 characters, as in
<pre>
        $prefix.m.edit.menu add command &#92
                -label "Select All" &#92
                -underline 0 &#92
                -accelerator "C-/" &#92
                -command "$this selectall"
</pre>
Notice that the line breaks are carefully chosen so
that the options are easy to identify.  Avoid the following
variant:

<pre>
        $prefix.m.edit.menu add command &#92
                -label "Select All" &#92
                -underline 0 -accelerator "C-/" &#92
                -command "$this selectall"
</pre>
Glancing at this, it is easy to miss the <CODE>-accelerator</CODE>
option.

In Java, you can often use the <CODE>+</CODE> operator to concatenate
<CODE>Strings</CODE> together:
<pre>
	return "This is a really " +
	       "long string";
</pre>

<h2><a name="comment conventions">Comment conventions</a></h2>

<MENU>
<LI> Comments should include honest information about the limitations of
the object definition.

<LI> Comments should be complete sentences and complete thoughts.

</MENU>


<h2><a name="naming conventions">Naming conventions</a></h2>

<p>In Java, there is no limit to name sizes (as it should be).
Do not hesitate to use long names.

 <P>Method and variable names that are <CODE>protected</CODE> 
or <CODE>private</CODE>
a leading underscore "<CODE>_</CODE>".
(i.e. <CODE>_protectedMethod()</CODE>, <CODE>_privateMethod()</CODE>.

 <P>Method names should have internal capitalization and start with
a lower case letter (i.e. <CODE>aPublicMethod()</CODE>).

 <P>If possible, variables should not use internal capitalization,
unless the name is long.  This makes it easier to distinguish between
methods and variables.  However, avoiding capitalization in variable
names is up to the implementer.

 <P>Method and variable names should avoid using underscores internally. 

<h2><a name="java exceptions conventions">Java exceptions conventions</a></h2>
Java exception classes that are part of the <CODE>pt.kernel.util</CODE> package
in <A HREF="../../pt/kernel/util"><CODE>$PTII/pt/kernel/util</CODE></A> should
follow these conventions.
<MENU>
<LI> All <CODE>pt</CODE> package exceptions should extend
<A HREF="../../pt/kernel/util/KernelException.java">KernelException</A>
so that we can catch these exceptions at runtime.  By having a hierarchy
of exceptions, we can differentiate between generic Java exceptions and
exceptions that the pt package has thrown.

<LI> Exceptions should be defined in the same package as the classes
that throw them.  The exceptions in java.lang follow this convention.

<LI> In Java, most Exceptions have two constructors, a nullary constructor
and a constructor that takes a String detail argument.
 <br> In the Ptolemy II kernel, Exceptions have these two constructors
as well as constructors that take one or two NamedObj arguments.
The purpose of the NamedObj arguments is to provide a uniform interface
and look and feel to exception messages.


<LI> When throwing an exception, it is best if the detail message is
a complete sentence that includes a string that describes to object
that caused the exception.  For example
<PRE>
throw MyException(this, "The list already contains an element named `" + 
	getElementName() +"'.");
</PRE>

</MENU>


<h2><a name="copyright conventions">Copyright and Acknowledgements</a></h2>

We would prefer to be able to release Ptolemy II with the 
<A HREF="../../copyright">standard UC Berkeley copyright</A>,
which allows for subsequent commercialization.
However, this is a large project, and we should use existing
code as much as possible.  The following scenarios are possible:
<ul>
<li> An uncopyrighted program (public domain) is used either verbatim
or as inspiration.  In this case, it is essential to acknowledge the
author and institution originating the code, but this has no effect
on our copyright policy.

<li> A copylefted program (under the Gnu public license) is used
as inspiration.  If there is no verbatim code used, then it
is sufficient (and necessary) to acknowledge the author and
institution.

<li> A copylefted program or portion of a program is used verbatim.
This will place the entire Tycho program under the Gnu public license,
and therefore should be done only with good reason.  However, we are
not averse to doing this.  If you include copylefted code,
<em>be sure to identify every line of code that is borrowed in this
way</em>.  This will allow us (or someone else) to later rewrite this
code and liberate Tycho from the copyleft.

</ul>
In all cases, any foreign code that you use should be carefully
read and tested.  Yes, it should be read!
Preferably, it should be reformatted to fit our programming
style, but if it is a large piece of code, it is probably not
worth doing.  We will need to devise a scheme to avoid
confusing the automatic documentation generator.
If it is Tcl/Tk code, it <em>must</em> be ported to Tk 4.0
(a nontrivial task).  If it is not Itcl code, it should
be carefully searched for namespace violations.

 <P>If your file is based on a file that has non-UC Berkeley
copyrights, then you should be sure to include the copyrights.

<h3><a name="SCCS and copyrights">SCCS and copyrights</a></h3>

Currently we are using the <CODE>&#37Q&#37</CODE> SCCS
directive to adjust the copyright dates automatically.  The
copyright should have <CODE>&#37Q&#37</CODE>
as the ending date of the copyright:
<CODE>1995-&#37Q&#37</CODE>
The Tycho interface to SCCS takes care of interpreting the
<CODE>&#37Q&#37</CODE>.

 <P>If your file is a rewrite of a previously copyrighted file from UC
Berkeley, then you should include the date from that file.

<h2><a name="proofreading">Proofreading</a></h2>

Software has become a publication medium.  People will read your code.
Your name is on it, so you want to be proud of it.  It seems that most
people stop working on the code when it "works."  This is like stopping
work on a paper when what it says is correct, and not worrying at all
about how it is said.  PROOFREAD YOUR CODE AFTER YOU'VE GOT IT WORKING.
 <p>
<a href="$PTII/util/testsuite/chkjava"><CODE>$PTII/util/testsuite/chkjava</CODE></a> is a script that will indicate problems with your <CODE>.java</CODE>
files.  To run it, type
<pre>
$PTII/util/testsuite/chkjava *.java
</pre>
 <p>You should also spell check your code with <CODE>spell *.java</CODE>.
