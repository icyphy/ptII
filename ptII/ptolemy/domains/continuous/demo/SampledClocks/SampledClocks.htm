This model demonstrates that the sampled clock
signals are different. The sampled continuous
clock signal has some delay compared with the
sampled discrete clock signal. The delay is the
the sample period of the sampler. As the sample
period goes to 0.0, the delay goes to 0.0.

<p>The cause of the delay can be interpreted as
samplers only sample the signals with some set 
up time. 

<p>Caution: The model shows a deterministic behavior
of the samplers, while in reality, non-deterministic
behaviors caused by the timer issues usually can 
not be avoided. We don't recommend to use sampler
to sample the signals with discontinuities in models
design. </p>
