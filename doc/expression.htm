<TITLE>The Ptolemy II Expression Language</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<h1>The Ptolemy II Expression Language</h1>
<P>
Ptolemy II includes a simple but extensible expression language. 
This language permits operations on tokens to be specified in a
scripting fashion, without requiring compilation of Java code.
The expression language can be used to define parameters in terms
of other parameters, for example. It can also be used to provide
end-users with actors that compute a user-specified expression 
that refers to inputs and parameters of the actor. Here are some
examples of expressions:
<pre>
   x
   sin(2*PI*x + theta)
   (x == y) ? 1 : 2
   1 + 2i        /* this is a comment. */
   "string-valued expression"
   {1, 2, 3}     /* an array */
   [1, 2, 3]     /* a 1x3 matrix */
   [1, 2; 3, 4]  /* a 2x2 matrix */
   [1:1:100]
   [1:1:100].toArray()
   {a=1, b=2}    /* record with two fields, named a and b */
   {a=1, b=2}.get(&quot;a&quot;)
</pre>
These examples assume that <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
and <code>theta</code> are variables within scope.
</P>
<H2> Variables</H2>
<P>
Expressions can contain references by name to variables that
are with scope.  What this means, exactly, depends on how the
expression is being used.  Here are two common cases:
<ul>
<li>
When an expression is giving the value of a parameter of an actor,
then all parameters of the actor and the container of the actor
are within scope.  That is, these parameters can appear (by name)
in an expression giving the value of the parameter.  A common
pattern is give the value of a parameter by giving the name
of another parameter that is in scope.
<li> 
When an expression is given in the Expression actor to define an
output value in terms of the input, then the inputs of the expression
actor may also be referenced by name. As with parameters, the parameters
of the container of the Expression actor are also withing scope.
</ul>
<H2>Arithmetic operators</H2>
<P>
The arithmetic operators are +, -, *, / and %,
where the latter is the remainder operator.
</P>
<P>
<H2>Bit manipulation</H2>
<P>
The bitwise operators are &amp;, |, ^ and &#126;. They operate 
on integers.</P>
<H2> Relational operators</H2>
<P>
The relational operators are &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=,
<code>==</code> and !=. They return booleans.</P>
<H2> Logical operators</H2>
<P>
The logical boolean operators are &amp;&amp;, ||, !, &amp; 
and |. They operate on booleans and return booleans. Note that the difference 
between logical &amp;&amp; and logical &amp; is that &amp; evaluates all 
the operands regardless of whether their value is now irrelevant. Similarly 
for logical || and |. This approach is borrowed from Java.</P>
<H2> Conditionals</H2>
<P> The syntax for conditionals is: </PRE>
<PRE>
    boolean ? value1 : value2
</PRE>
<P> If the boolean is true, <EM CLASS="Code"> value1</EM> is 
  returned, otherwise <EM CLASS="Code"> value2</EM> is returned.</P>
<H2> Comments</H2>
<P> Anything inside /*...*/ in an expression is ignored.</P>
<H2> Constants</H2>
<P>
The following constants are built in:
<i>PI</i>, <i>pi</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>true</i>, <i>false</i>,
<i>i</i>, and <i>j</i>. The constants i and j are complex numbers with
value equal to the 0.0 + 1.0i. In addition, literal constants are
supported. Anything between quotes, &quot;...&quot;, is interpreted as
a string constant. Numerical values without decimal points, such as
10 or -3 are integers. Numerical values with
decimal points, such as 10.0 or 3.14159 are
doubles. Integers followed by the character l (el) or
L are long integers.
</P>
<H2>
Arrays</H2>
<P>
Arrays are specified with curly brackets. E.g., <code>{1, 2, 3}</code>
is an array
of integers, while <code>{&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;}</code>
is an array of strings. An array is an ordered list of tokens of
any type, with the only constraint being that the elements all have the
same type. Thus, for example, <code>{1, 2.3}</code> is illegal because
the first element is an integer and the second is a double. The
elements of the array can be given by expressions, as in the example
<code>{2*pi, 3*pi}</code>. Arrays can be nested; for example,
<code>{{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}}</code> is an array of arrays of integers.
</P>

<H2>Matrices</H2>
<P>

Matrices are specified with square brackets, using commas to separate
row elements and semicolons to separate rows. E.g.,
<code>[1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 5+1]</code> gives a two by three integer matrix
(2 rows and 3 columns). Note
that an array or matrix element can be given by an expression. A row
vector can be given as <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> and a column vector as
<code>[1; 2; 3]</code>. Some
Matlab-style array constructors are supported. For example,
<code>[1:2:9]</code>
gives an array of odd numbers from 1 to 9, and is equivalent to
<code>[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</code>. Similarly,
<code>[1:2:9; 2:2:10]</code> is equivalent to
<code>[1, 3, 5, 7, 9; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code>.
</P>
<H2>Matrix references</H2>
<P>
Reference to matrices have the form <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
name</EM>
(<EM CLASS="Emphasis">
n</EM>
, <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
m</EM>
) where <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
name</EM>
 is the name of a matrix variable in scope (or a constant matrix), <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
n</EM>
 is the row index, and <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
m</EM>
 is the column index. Index numbers start with zero, as in Java, not 1, as in Matlab. With row vectors, it is not necessary to specify both indices. Thus, if <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
name</EM>
 = [1, 3, 5, 7], then <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
name</EM>
(2) will evaluate to 5. To access elements of a column vector, you must specify both indices, so if <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
name</EM>
 = [1; 3; 5; 7] then <EM CLASS="Emphasis">
name</EM>
(2,0) evaluates to 5.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2>Records</H2>
<P>
A record token is a composite type where each element is named, and
each element can have a distinct type. Records are delimited by curly
braces, with each element given a name. For example,
<code>{a=1, b=&quot;foo&quot;}</code> is a record with two elements, named
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, with values 1 (an integer) and &quot;foo&quot;
(a string), respectively. The
value of a record element can be an arbitrary expression, and records
can be nested (an element of a record token may be a record token).
</P>
<H2>Functions</H2>
<P>
The language includes an extensible set of functions, such as sin(),
cos(), etc. The functions that are built in include all static methods
of the java.lang.Math class and the ptolemy.data.expr.UtilityFunctions
class. The functions
currently available are shown below, with their argument types
and return types. At this time, in release 1.0, the types must match
exactly for the expression evaluator to work. Thus, sin(1)
fails, because the argument to the sin() function is required to be a
double.
<P>
One slightly subtle function is the random() function. It takes no
arguments, and hence is written <code>random()</code> . It
returns a random number. However, this function is evaluated only when
the expression within which it appears is evaluated. The result of the
expression may be used repeatedly without re-evaluating the expression.
The random() function is not called again. Thus, for example, if the
value parameter of the Const actor is set to
<code>random()</code> , then its output will be a random constant; i.e., it
will not change on each firing.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Every element and subexpression in an expression represents an instance of
the class ptolemy.data.Token (or more likely, a class derived from Token).
The expression language
supports invocation of methods of a given token. The syntax for
this is (<EM>token</EM>).
<EM>name</EM>(<EM>args</EM>), where <EM>name</EM> is the name of the
method and <EM>args</EM> is a comma-separated set of arguments.
Each argument can itself be an expression. Note that the parentheses
around the <EM>token</EM> are not required, but might be useful for clarity.
As an example, the ArrayToken class has a getElement(int) method, which can
be used as follows:</P>
<PRE>
    {1, 2, 3}.getElement(1)
</PRE>
<P>
This returns the integer 2. Another useful function of array token is
illustrated by the following example:</P>
<PRE>
    {1, 2, 3}.length()
</PRE>
<P>
which returns the integer 3.
The MatrixToken classes have three particularly useful methods, illustrated in the following examples:
</P>
<PRE>
    [1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6].getRowCount()
</PRE>
<P>
which returns 3, and
</P>
<PRE>
    [1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6].getColumnCount()
</PRE>
<P>
which returns 2, and</P>
<PRE>
    [1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6].toArray()
</PRE>
<P>
which returns <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</code>. The latter function can
be particularly useful for creating arrays using Matlab-style syntax.
For example, to contain an array with the integers from 1 to 100, you
can enter:</P>
<PRE>
    [1:1:100].toArray()
</PRE>
<P>
The get() method of RecordToken accesses a record, as in the following example:
</P>
<PRE>
    {a=1, b=2}.get(&quot;a&quot;)
</PRE>
<P>
which returns 1.
</P>
<H2>Types</H2>
<P>
The types currently supported in the language are boolean, complex,
fixed point, double, int, long, arrays, matrices and string. Note that
there is no float or byte. Use double or int instead. A complex is
defined by appending an <code>i</code> or a <code>j</code> to a double
for the imaginary part. Thus 2 + 3i will result in the
expected complex number.
</P>
<P>
The Token classes from the data package form the primitives of the
language. For example the number 10 becomes an IntToken with the value
10 when evaluating an expression. Normally this is invisible to the
user. The expression language is object-oriented, of course, so methods
can be invoked on these primitives. A sophisticated user, therefore,
can make use of the fact that 10 is in fact an object to invoke methods
of that object.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the convert() method of the Token class might be useful,
albeit a bit subtle in how it is used. For example:
</P>
<PRE>
    (1.2).convert(1)
</PRE>
<P>
creates a DoubleToken with value 1.2, and then invokes its convert()
method with argument 1, which is an IntToken. The convert() method of
DoubleToken converts the argument to a DoubleToken, so the result of
this expression is (somewhat surprisingly) 1.0.
</P>
<P>
The convert() method
supports only lossless type conversion.
Lossy conversion has to be done explicitly via a
function call .
<H2>Fixed Point Data</H2>
<P>
A fixed-point value in the expression language is given
using the following format: 
<pre>
    fix(<i>value</i>, <i>integerBits</i>, <i>fractionBits</i>)
</pre>
Thus, a fixed point value of 5.375 that uses 8 bit precision,
of which 4 bits are used to represent the integer part,
can be represented as:
<pre>
    fix(5.375, 8, 4)
</pre>
</P>
<H2>Limitations</H2>
<P>
The expression language has a rich potential, and only some of this potential
has been realized. Here are some of the current limitations:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The class ptolemy.data.util.UtilityFunctions containing the utility
functions is far from complete.</LI>
<LI>
Functions in the ptolemy.math package need to be supported in much the
same way that java.lang.Math is supported.</LI>
<LI>
Method calls are currently only allowed on tokens in the ptolemy.data package,
not arbitrary Java objects.
</LI>
<LI>
Statements are not supported. It is not clear that they ever will be,
since currently the expression language is strictly functional,
and converting it to imperative semantics could drastically change
its flavor.
