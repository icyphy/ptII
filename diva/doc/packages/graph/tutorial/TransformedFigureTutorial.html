<h1>Giving a figure a transform context</h1>

<p>
This tutorial illustrates how to write a figure that contains its own
transform context. On the FigureTutorial page, we showed how to make a
custom figure, and how to transform the various 2D shapes in the
paint() method. Here, we will use an AffineTransform to do the same
thing. This technique is a little more work to figure out how to do,
but it probably better if your figure has more than a couple of Shapes
in it.

<p> Transforms are a little tricky to get right, so the Diva Canvas
provides a class, TransformContext, that you need to use to give a
figure its own transform. Each instance of TransformContext contains a
single AffineTransform, and a bunch of methods that deal with it.

<p> The start of the CloudFigure class contains this code:

<pre>
    private TransformContext _transformContext;
    private Rectangle2D _cachedBounds = null;
    private Shape _cachedShape = null;

    public CloudFigure (
            double x, double y,
            double width, double height ) {

        _transformContext = new TransformContext(this);
        AffineTransform at = _transformContext.getTransform();
        at.translate(x,y);
        at.scale(width/100, height/100);
        _transformContext.invalidateCache();

	....
    } 
</pre>

The initial shape of this figure is in fact a "cloud" shape
that is located at (0,0) and is 100 units on each side. The
internal transform is therefore initialized to scale this
shape to the requested coordinates.

<p>
Now, because the shape of this figure is fairly expensive to
transform, the two instance variables <b>_cachedBounds</b> and
<b>_cachedShape</b> store the bounds and shape for the current
transform. If you look at the source code for this class, you will see
that these are created and remembered in getBounds() and
getShape(). In getShape(), for example, the internally-stored
shape needs to be transformed into "external" coordinates:

<pre>
    public Shape getShape () {
        if (_cachedShape == null) {
            AffineTransform at = _transformContext.getTransform();
            _cachedShape = at.createTransformedShape(_shape);
        }
        return _cachedShape;
    }
</pre>

Whenever the transform changes, these shapes must be cleared.
For example:

<pre>
    public void transform (AffineTransform at) {
        repaint();
        _cachedShape = null;
        _cachedBounds = null;
        _transformContext.preConcatenate(at);
        repaint();
    }
</pre>

<p>
The only other interesting thing about this class is the
paint() method. Because paint() is called recursively down
the tree of figures, the TransformContext class provides
two methods that "stack" transform contexts as the tree
is traversed. The paint() method calls push() and pop()
before and after painting the figure's contents:

<pre>
    public void paint (Graphics2D g) {
        _transformContext.push(g);

	....
        // Paint the big cloud
        AlphaComposite c = AlphaComposite.getInstance(
                AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER,0.5f);
        g.setComposite(c);
        g.setPaint(Color.magenta);
        g.fill(_shape);

	....
        _transformContext.pop(g);
    }
</pre>

That's about all that's needed to use transform contexts
in a figure.
