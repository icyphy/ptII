  2. (TypeConstant, double) &lt;= (variable .Top.Map.resolution: double)
  3. (TypeConstant, {grid = arrayType(int,2), height = int, width = int}) &lt;= (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int})
  4. (port .Top.Map.map: unknown) &lt;= (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int})
  5. (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int}) &lt;= (port .Top.Map.map: unknown)
The constraints of the clone:
  1. (TypeConstant, arrayType(double,2)) &lt;= (variable .Top.Map.origin: arrayType(double))
  2. (TypeConstant, double) &lt;= (variable .Top.Map.resolution: double)
  3. (TypeConstant, {grid = arrayType(int,2), height = int, width = int}) &lt;= (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int})
  4. (port .Top.Map.map: unknown) &lt;= (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int})
  5. (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int}) &lt;= (port .Top.Map.map: unknown)
Congrats, the constraints are the same.
