<h1>Ptolemy II 8.0.1 Release Notes</h1>

Ptolemy II is a set of Java packages supporting heterogeneous,
concurrent modeling and design.  Its <code>kernel</code> package
supports clustered hierarchical graphs, which are collections of
<I>entities</I> and <I>relations</I> between those entities.  Its
<code>actor</code> package extends the kernel so that entities have
functionality and can communicate via the relations.  Its
<I>domains</I> extend the actor package by imposing <I>models of
computation</I> on the interaction between entities.  Examples of
models of computation include discrete-event systems, dataflow,
process networks, synchronous/reactive systems, and communicating
sequential processes.

 <p>Ptolemy II includes a number of support packages, such as 

 <br><code>data</code>, providing a type system, data encapsulation and an
 expression parser,

 <br><code>plot</code>, providing visual display of data,

 <br><code>math</code>, providing matrix and vector math and signal
processing functions, and

 <br><code>graph</code>, providing graph-theoretic manipulations.


 <p>The three volumes of the Ptolemy II Design Document

<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 8.0.1 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK 1.5 or later.

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 8.0.1 under Mac OS 10.5 and Windows Server 2003
and with JDK1.5.0._22.

<p>Ptolemy II 8.0 will not compile under Java 1.3 because we use the
java.lang.URI class, which is present only in Java 1.4 and later.
JDK 1.5 or later is required so that these packages can use generics:
backtrack, ptalon and others.


 <p>Ptolemy II has been compiled and run
under IBM JDK 1.6.0.  There are the following limitations
under IBM JDK 1.6.0
<menu>
<li> The Copernicus code generator does not work.
<li> Caltrop does not work.
<li> The IBM JDK seems to return directory contents in a different
order than the Sun JDK.  Thus actor.lib.io.DirectoryListing
might return elements in a different order.

<h3><a name="modelTransformation">Model Transformation</a></h3>

<p>The model transformation facility provides a framework for the
analysis and transformation of actor models using model transformation
techniques.

<p>The design of large-scale models poses a number of challenges. As
the size of the models increases to thousands of actors or hundreds of
thousands of actors, analysis and consistent modification on the
models become extremely hard. Furthermore, to maximize component
reuse, a systematic approach is needed for the specification and
maintenance of common patterns in the models and the transformation of
those patterns.

<p>The model transformation framework to be developed in this project
aims to support the flexible specification of patterns and
replacements by means of rules in graph grammar. An intuitive
graphical user interface will be built. For novice users, a set of
common transformations will be included in a library to facilitate
their common tasks.

<p>The transformations are models in their own right. They can be
embedded in larger models hierarchically. Heterogeneous models of
computation can be used to control the application of individual
"atomic" transformations. This makes it easy to create sophisticated
transformations by composing simple ones in a manageable and
disciplined way. The sophisticated transformations will also take
advantage of the concurrency inherent in those models of computation.

<p>Model transformation can be applied as an optimization of modal
models. These are hierarchical state machines with refinements in
their states, which are sub-models to be executed when those states
are active. The current implementation includes the complete
description of each refinement in the model description, even though
refinements of the states in a state machine tend to have large
commonality. With the transformation technique, only one refinement
needs to be stored completely. The others are obtained by
transformations performed on the stored refinement. This eliminates
redundancy and eases the job of modifying multiple refinements
consistently.

<p>Other applications of the model transformation technique include
recognizing common design patterns in the models in a static analysis,
replacing exiting design patterns with more efficient ones, and
reusing design patterns by incorporating them into new models.

<h3><a name="pteraDomain">Ptera (Ptolemy Event Relationship Actor) Domain</a></h3>

<p>The Ptera (Ptolemy Event Relationship Actor) domain is a discrete-event model of computation. A model in Ptera is represented with a graph of nodes and edges, where nodes represent events and directed edges between events represent scheduling relation. One or more events can be selected as initial events, which are scheduled
at model time 0.0. When an event is fired, it possibly performs certain actions, and if there are outgoing edges from that event, the events at the end points of those edges are scheduled after non-negative delays. One or more events can also be selected as final events. The firing of final events causes the event
queue to be emptied after their actions are performed, and therefore no more events can be processed.

<p>The Ptera domain supports a different kind of modal models called PteraModalModels, compared to modal models using FSMs (Finite State Machines) as the control. A PteraModalModel uses Ptera at the top level, and each event is refined into a sub-model. The refinements can use Ptera and any other Ptolemy models of computation.

<p>A Ptera model is timed. Although it should work in many domains, the DE (Discrete-Event) domain or Ptera domain itself are recommended. When embedded in those domains, the scheduling of the Ptera model is delegated to the container by calling the fireAt() function of its director.

<p>There are many useful additional features for Ptera, such as canceling edges and parameters. A canceling edge, denoted by a dotted line, cancels a previously scheduled event instead of scheduling a new one. If the pointed to event has multiple instances in the event queue, then the first instance is cancelled.
Events may also have parameters, and the actual values for those parameters are specified by the expressions on the edges that schedule them. Those expressions are evaluated at run-time. The events may refer to the values of those parameters in their actions by parameter names.

<h3><a name="causalityanalysis">Causality Analysis</a></h3>
Ptolemy II 8.0 includes an update to our Causality Analysis framework.
We identified performance problems with our current
non-conservative causality analysis for modal models within
discrete-event (DE) systems. In this scheme, causality analysis is
performed on the entire model at run time each time there is a mode
change in the model. This mechanism is far too costly. We are
investigating techniques for performing the causality analysis in a
compositional way for the various modes at compile
time. Unfortunately, brute force solutions result in exponentially
growing memory requirements for the results of the causality analysis.

<p>We designed, implemented and reviewed an interface that defines a
causality interfaces for actor networks as described in the paper
"<a href="#ZhouLee:08:CausalityInterfaces">Causality Interfaces for Actor Networks</a>."

<p>Causality interfaces are also described in Ye Zhou Ph.D. Thesis,
"<a href="#Zhou:07:Interface">Interface Theories for Causality Analysis in Actor Networks.</a>"


<p>Causality interfaces represent dependencies between input and output
ports of an actor and can be used to perform scheduling or static
analysis on actor models.  

<p>This substantial new work helps address performance problems in
large Discrete Event (DE) models.  The new work provides
more efficient static analysis for directed cycles and scheduling.
This work solved a bug concerning execution time with DE models
that had many actors at one level of hierarchy.  The table
below illustrates the improvement.

<p>    One of the challenges in complex, heterogeneous models is that
   portions of the model have temporal behavior while other portions
   are purely functional. We have reworked the interfaces that
   hierarchically heterogeneous models in Ptolemy II present to one
   another for managing the passage of time. This rework supports
   much more robust multithreaded and distributed execution without
   compromising temporal coherence. Concretely, we have defined a
   formalism whereby a model requests temporal behavior of its
   container in the hierarchy, and the container responds with an
   indication of the extent to which it can honor the request.  If
   the extent is sufficient for the application, then the models are
   compatibly composed. Otherwise, they are not, and the model is
   marked defective.

<h3><a name="continuousModal">Continuous and Modal Domains</a></h3>
<p>Ptolemy II 8.0 includes a substantial rework of modal models and
the underlying finite state machine infrastructure to make them work
predictably and consistently across domains.</p>

<p>Ptolemy II 8.0 includes a new implementation of continuous-time models
based on the semantics given in "<a href="#LeeZheng:07:Leveraging">Synchronous Language Principles for Heterogeneous Modeling
and Design of Embedded Systems</a>." In particular, the Continuous domain cleanly supports
continuous-time models (using an ODE solver), discrete-event models,
and arbitrary mixtures of the two, including signals that combine
continuous-time segments with discrete events. It also interoperates
cleanly with most other domains (pretty much all except PN and
Rendezvous, for which there does not appear to be reasonable semantic
model of such an interaction). Modal models are also cleanly supported
with the Continuous domain, enabling hybrid system modeling with a
rigorous semantics. The Continuous domain is expected to eventually
replace CT.</p>

<h2><a name="other">Other Key New Capabilities</a></h2>
<ul>
<li> New width inference algorithm
<br>Relations have a width specifying the number of channels of that relation.
Having to explicitly specify this width can be a tedious job. To make it even
worse, the addition of one relation to a multiport might result in a model
builder needing to go through the model again to adapt widths. To cope
with this you can now set the width to <i>Auto</i>. In this case the width of the relation
is inferred from other relations or other ports with a graph algorithm. This
algorithm removes a lot of restriction that were present in the previous implementation.
In this implementation we tried to
come up with a solution that can infer the width of all relations for most scenarios without
imposing a large performance cost. The algorithm propagates the widths
it knows and at multiports tries to infer the widths of other relations from
these propagated widths.</p>
<p>For certain actors there is a relation between the widths of the input ports
and the widths of the output ports. To resolve this problem, <i>width constraints</i> on
ports have been introduced. There exists two types of width constraints.
The first one imposes an equality constraints between two different ports. With the second type of constraints you can set the width of a port equal to
a certain parameter.</p>

<p>The last step of the algorithm is a <i>consistency check</i> in which it is checked
that the solution obtained by the width inference algorithm is a unique one.
A non unique solution is treated as a error. </p>

<p>In this release the default width has also been changed from <i>1</i> to <i>Auto</i>.
<br>(Bert Rodiers) </p>
</li>

<li> <i>New model generators for verification</i>.
<p> This release contains capabilities to generate, from Ptolemy models, other types of models,
suitable for formal verification. In particular, the <i>Formal Model Converter</i> component
(developed by Chihhong Patrick Cheng) allows to generate models compatible with the SMV or NuSMV 
model-checkers, from Ptolemy models in the SR domain. Also, the <i>RTMaudeCodeGenerator</i> component
(developed by Kyungmin Bae) allows to generate models compatible with the Real Time Maude tool,
from Ptolemy models in the DE domain.

<li><i><a name="configurableui">Configurable User Interface</a></i>
<br>GUI (graphical user interface) properties allow Ptolemy II users or redistributors
to configure the Ptolemy user interface by simply making changes to configuration
files in the XML format. For example, buttons on the tool bar or menu items specific
to a certain application domain can be added that trigger user-defined actions. Those
actions may be defined in Java classes or as MoML change requests to be applied to the
model being edited.

<li><i><a name="threadedcomposite">ThreadedComposite</a></i>
<br>The ThreadedComposite actor supports execution of either an atomic actor
or a composite actor in a separate thread. It thus brings multithreading
to Ptolemy domains where the director does not use threads, such as
DE, SR, and SDF.  The actor can be used to get parallel execution on
multicore machines, to execute actors that block on I/O without blocking
the model execution, and to execute actors in the background.

<li><i>Lazy Opening of Composites</i>
<br>
LazyTypedCompositeActor is a replacement for TypedCompositeActor that does lazy evaluation, which means that he contents of a LazyTypedCompositeActor are not evaluated at runtime, instead they are evaluated at start up time.  LazyTypedCompositeActor was developed to improve the opening time of very large models. One issue is that this changes the results slightly because different results will occur if the results depend on the order in which actors are created. Unforuntately, the scheme we have for setting seeds in the random number generator "deterministically" has this property.

<li><i>printPDF</i>
<br>Vergil and Ptplot now handle an optional <code>-printPDF</code>
command line argument.  This option finds the first printer with the
string <code>PDF</code> in the name and then prints to that printer.
Thus, <code>-printPDF</code> requires that the full (non-free) version of
Adobe Acrobat be installed, or some other method of printing to PDF.
Unfortunately, the location of the resulting PDF file is not easily
controlled, on the Mac look in <code>~/Documents/Java Printing.pdf</code>.

 <li> Level-crossing links are now correctly exported
   to MoML.  The way this works is that the lowest common
   container of the objects being linked is responsible for
   producing the MoML description of the link. This ensures
   that when the MoML is encountered for creating the link,
   that both objects being linked have already been created.

</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII8.0/limitations.htm#in_browser" target="_top">Ptolemy II 8.0.1 Limitations Page</a> - Limitations found after release.
<li><a
href="http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/bugs.html" target="_top">Ptolemy II Bugzilla</a>
</ul>
Version 8.0.1 has the following limitations:

<h3>Release Limitations</h3>
<ul>

<li> The gzipped tar file of Ptolemy II  source files with Unix line endings
(<code>ptII8.0.1.src.tar.gz</code>)
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.
 <p>Note further that some of the .class names are longer than
31 characters, which may cause problems when downloading zip files
on the Macintosh and using Stuffit.

<li> The documentation for custom actors used in demonstrations is not
included in the release.  The source code for the custom actors can be found
in the source download.

<li> If a URL ends with <CODE>#in_browser</CODE>, then
Ptolemy II will invoke the User's web browser.  Unfortunately, this
does not always work, especially under Windows if Netscape is already
running.  The workaround is to exit Netscape and let Ptolemy II
start up Netscape for you.

<li> Web Start does not work very well if the pathname to the 
<CODE>vergil.jnlp</CODE> file has spaces in it.  The workaround is
to place your Ptolemy II tree in a directory that does not have spaces
in the path name if you plan on using Web Start.

<li> If your user library contains actors that are not present in
vergil, then you may see a dialog or dialogs asking if you want
to skip these elements.  This could happen if you had developed custom
actors and put them into your user library and these custom actors
are not present in the release.  The work around is to click 'Skip Element'
and continue with the start up.


<li> Installer issues

        <ul>

	  <li> We don't like the first window that pops up, it is
	  rather blank and seems unnecessary.  However, if we don't
	  have that first window pop up, then the html pane that is
	  rendered in the second window is sometimes the wrong size.
	  We think this is an event thread issue, but we have not
	  checked.

	  <li>Mac OS X installer issues:
	    <ul> 

	      <li>When the  download the Mac installer, it does not automatically open,
		The user has to go to the downloads folder and open it.

	      <li>After installing, Vergil.app is rather hard to find.  <code>Vergil.app</code>
		is in <code>bin/</code>, the default location is
		<code>/Applications/Ptolemy/ptII8.0.1/bin/Vergil.app</code>
		The reason we use this path is because if the user rebuilds, then the
		<code>Vergil.app</code> script will be generated
		in <code>bin/</code>

	      <li>On the command line, the <code>open</code> command does not work. 
		<pre>
		  open -a Vergil Adder.xml
		</pre>
		it starts Vergil, but it doesn't open Adder.xml

		<br>To fix this would require having Ptolemy use Apple Java Extensions, much like
		Kepler does.  See also
		<a href="http://book.javanb.com/mac-os-x-for-java-geeks/0596004001_macxjvgks-chp-5.html#in_browser" target="_top"><code>http://book.javanb.com/mac-os-x-for-java-geeks/0596004001_macxjvgks-chp-5.html#macxjvgks-CHP-5</code></a>.
            </ul>

	</ul>

<li> Applet issues:
	<ul>
	<li> Applets seem to run out of memory after about 82Mb.  The workaround
	  is to either restart your browser or to use the Web Start versions.
	  
        <li> The Ptalon applets don't work because antlr tries to get
           properties.         
	  <!-- appletviewer $PTII/ptolemy/actor/ptalon/demo/CruiseControl/CruiseControlVergil.htm --> 
  	  <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

        <li> Distributed SDF applets are very difficult or impossible
	  to run because the user must start up servers.
        <!-- appletviewer $PTII/ptolemy/distributed/demo/Sleep/SleepVergil.htm -->
        <!-- Confirmed on 2/23/10 -->

	<li>The caltrop applets fail because caltrop.main.Util.setDBFI()
	  calls setProperty to set the parser:
        <pre> 
        System.setProperty("javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory", name);
        </pre>
        The workaround is to run the caltrop demos as Web Start applications.

	   -->    
          </pre>
        <!-- Confirmed on 2/23/10 -->

	<li> Running the Networked demo via an applet on the local
	file system results in an AccessControlException.
<pre>
com.microstar.htm.htmException: XML element "entity" triggers exception:
  java.lang.Exception: Attempted to lookup 'Waveform', but got: 
  java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Waveform
Attempted to find as a moml class, but got:

	at ptolemy.actor.gui.MoMLApplet._createModel(MoMLApplet.java:188)
</pre>

	The Network demo does not work as a local applet because the xml file
	includes a reference to http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu, which is
	not on the local file system, so we get a SecurityException.
	 <br>The workaround is to run the applet by downloading it
	from the Ptolemy Website:
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII8.0/ptII8.0.1/ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/Networked.htm" target="_top"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII8.0/ptII8.0.1/ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/Networked.htm</CODE></a>
        <!-- appletviewer $PTII/ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/NetworkedVergil.htm -->
        <!-- Confirmed on 2/23/10 -->

	<li> If an icon file is not present, then a Vergil applet might
	try to download the icon file multiple times.  Ptolemy II
	uses XML files to store icons.  For example
<a href="../ptolemy/actor/lib/BooleanSwitchIcon.htm"><CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/BooleanSwitchIcon.htm</CODE></a>
	is an icon for
<a href="../ptolemy/actor/lib/BooleanSwitch.java"><CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/BooleanSwitch.java</CODE></a>
	 <br>The problem is that if an actor does not have an icon file,
	then the applet may go back to the server multiple times looking
	for the icon.

      I think the MoMLParser should load Java-defined classes the same way
      it does xml-defined classes.  It should reflect a prototype and then
      keep the prototype around and clone it...  This would mean that it
      only has to grab the icon once...
 -->

	</ul>

<li> Web Start issues:
	<ul>

	  <li> The Web Start download tends to be large because we are
	    not using lazy downloading.
	  
	  <li> The modelTransformation HierarchyFlattening demo fails under
	    Web Start.
	    When the "Match Ptolemy models in a directory" button is pressed, the a
	    window with the title "Error" and the contents:
	    <blockquote>
	      Directory "/ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII8.0/jnlp-8.0.1/signed/ptolemy/actor/gt/patterns"
	      does not exist, the value of the DefaultDirectoryAttribute parameter was "$PTII/ptolemy/actor/gt/patterns"
 	    </blockquote>
	    There is no stack trace.  This is annoying,
	    it is like "Abort, Retry, Cancel?" because it does not tell the user 
	    where the error occurred.
	    The offending code is in ptolemy/vergil/gt/TransformationEditor.java
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

	  <li> The Matlab Wireless demo fails under Web Start.
	    Currently, the problem is that the share library cannot be found
	    Formerly, the problem was that the Matlab .m file cannot be found.
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

	  <li> Viewing a pdf file may bring up a blank window along with
	    the pdf file.  Running the code generator may bring up
	    a blank window while the java or javac processes are running.

	  <li> Some of the links on the GR domain instructions page
	    might not work under Web Start because the files they refer
	    to are not present. 

	  <li> The ModelTranformation PublisherTest model fails under
            Web Start because it can't find the file in ../../test.
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

          <li> The ptalon/gt/demo/Adder/Adder.xml model does not work in
            Web Start because it can't find the BaseModel.xml.
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

          <li> The ptolemy/demo/RunDemos.xml mode does not work in Web Start
            because the .xml files can't be found.
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

          <li> The ExecDemos model fails to run under Web Start - there is no vergil script.
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

	  <li> <a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=298" target="_top">Bug #298: ptinyViewer and fullViewer should optionally disable selection and drag</a>
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

       </ul>

<li> Limitations in demonstrations (alphabetical by domain and demonstration)
        <ul>

	  <li> The CT CarTracking demonstration should be run using View-&gt;Run
	    so that the user can change the fault parameter.

	  <li> The database domain needs a space database demo that uses some sort of dummy public database.
	    Java 1.6 includes Java db, see
	    <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/forsini/archive/2006/06/java_db_is_now.html" target="_top">http://weblogs.java.net/blog/forsini/archive/2006/06/java_db_is_now.html</a>.
	    However, Mac would need a separate install.

	  <li> The DDF RijndaelEncryption demo never terminates. Note that we have two Rijndael demos, the
	    problem demo is at <code>$PTII/./ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/RijndaelEncryption/RijndaelEncryption.xml</code>
	    <!--  $PTII/bin/vergil ./ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/RijndaelEncryption/RijndaelEncryption.xml -->
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

	  <li><a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=324" target="_top">Bug #324: PN Gravitation codegen fails because of a segfault</a>
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

	  <li> The SDF Bouncer demo: If the user drags the bouncing icon, it no
	    longer bounces.
	    <!-- $PTII/bin/vergil $PTII/ptolemy/actor/parameters/demo/Bouncer/Bouncer.xml -->
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

	  <li> In HyVisual, the HSIF translater is merely a prototype,
	    it is not a full implementation of a HSIF translator.

        </ul>

<li> Minor Limitations in demonstrations (alphabetical by domain and demonstration)
        <ul>
	  <li> When the DE/GR Clock demo is run, the gong sound at the end is truncated.
	    <!-- $PTII/bin/vergil ~/ptII/ptolemy/domains/de/demo/Clock/Clock.xml -->
	    <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->

	  <li> The GT Model Execution demonstration highlights the stop button?
	    After hitting the run button, a model opens up and is running, but the toolbar icon has the stop
	    button highlighted?  Instead, the run button should be highlighted. 

	    <p>gt GameOfLife does something similar.  How do I stop it?

	    <p>Maybe these need to bring up a viewer that does not have a run button.
	      <!-- $PTII/bin/vergil ~/ptII8.0.1/ptolemy/actor/gt/demo/ModelExecution/ModelExecution.xml -->
	      <!-- Confirmed on 2/22/10 -->
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations in building</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=286" target="_top">Bug #286: JavaCC 4.1 and 4.2 fail because of ReInit() problems</a>.

  <li> The "export PDF" facility is incomplete.  The issue is that the library that is used is GPL'd, so we
    need to be sure that it is possible to build a version of Ptolemy that does not include the GPL'd library.
    One possible workaround would be to have an interim dialog pop up that tells the user how to
    install the library.

  <li> 1/8/07: GNU Make 3.81 no longer supports Windows style
    path names with colons in them.  The affects the Copernicus
    code generator because $PTII needs to be set to a pathname
    with a colon in it like <code>c:/Ptolemy/ptII8.0.1</code>.
    A path name like <code>/cygdrive/c/Ptolemy/ptII8.0.1</code>
    will <B>not</B> work with Java.

    <p>For example, if you run copernicus and copernicus runs
      make, you may see
      <pre>
	makefile:360: *** target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.
      </pre>
      This is because a makefile variable uses the windows style
      pathnames with colons in them.  One solution is to
      edit the file to use pathnames with /cygdrive.
      Another solution is to download a working version from
      <a href="http://www.cmake.org/files/cygwin/make.exe"><code>http://www.cmake.org/files/cygwin/make.exe</code></a>


    <p>For details, see

      <BLOCKQUOTE>

	<li> From: Christopher Faylor &lt;cgf-no-personal-reply-please at cygwin dot com&gt;

	<li> To: cygwin-announce at cygwin dot com

	<li> Date: Sun, 9 Jul 2006 18:13:29 -0400

	  <p>I've made a new version of 'make' available for download.  This updates
	    the package to the latest version available from fedora.redhat.com.
	    I've included the relevant portions of the NEWS file and the Fedora
	    ChangeLog at the end of this message.

	  <p>For a brief description of this package, see 
	    <a href="http://cygwin.com/packages/" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/packages/</a>.

	  <p>Note that the --win32 command line option and "MAKE_MODE" environment
	    variable are no longer supported in Cygwin's make.  If you need to use a
	    Makefile which contains MS-DOS path names, then please use a MinGW
	    version of make.

	  <p>See: <a href="http://mingw.org/" target="_top">http://mingw.org/</a>
	    for details on downloading a version of make
	    which understands MS-DOS path names.  Please! direct any questions about
	    the MinGW version of make to the appropriate MinGW mailing list.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      I have no idea what prompted this change, it seems really lame.
      The code worked fine under Cygwin for many years.  It seems like breaking
      an important tool such as make only hurts the GNU tools.  This means that it
      is <b>impossible</b> to use Cygwin make with Sun Java, which uses MS-DOS paths.

    <p>For further updates, see
      <a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55" target="_top"><code>https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55</code></a>.

    <p>4/26/07: Wile compiling in <code>$PTII/jni/test</code>,

      </pre>
      The problem was I was running a broken version of make and updating
      to

<h3>Limitations in the Actor Oriented Class Mechanism</h3>
The actor oriented class mechanism described in
<ul>
<li>Edward A. Lee, Xiaojun Liu, Stephen Neuendorffer. <a
href="http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/624.html" target="_top">Classes and inheritance in actor-oriented design</a>,
<i>ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems
(TECS)</i>, 8(4):Article No. 29, July 2009.
</ul>
has various restrictions and limitations:

<ul>
  <li> If an atomic actor is to be used in an Actor Oriented Class definition,
    then the atomic actor must have a properly implemented clone(Workspace) 
    method. See the design documents for details.

  <li> Several higher-order-components will not work inside class definitions.
    (ModalModel, several CT actors, etc.).

  <li> Name collisions can occur when adding objects to base classes
    whose names collide with objects in derived classes.
    Auto naming should look through the derivedList for name conflicts.

  <li> Propagation of changes to a base class is very slow in Vergil.
    If there are more than just a very few instances or derived
    classes, interactive editing is not practical.  As a workaround,
    put the class definitions in a separate file and edit them
    without opening the model that creates instances. The probable
    reason is that MoMLParser handles propagation by issuing large
    numbers of change requests.

  <li> Certain actors, such as MathFunction, change the number of ports
    when parameters change.  This violates the derivation invariance
    for classes.  To demonstrate the bug, put a MathFunction actor
    in a base class that has a subclass.  Change the function parameter
    in the subclass to anything but "modulo".  Then change the function
    in the base class to "modulo" (which adds a port).  Now attempt
    to insert a parameter into the port.  You will get an
    InternalErrorException when it tries to propagate the change.
</ul>


<h3>Limitations in the Actor Libraries</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The actor library is far from complete.

  <li>The Expression actor does not properly propagate type constraints in
  an expression-dependent fashion. It works correctly for double-valued
  expressions of double-valued inputs.

  <li> The Ptolemy parameter parser uses comma "," to separate elements
  in an array.  This causes problems when Ptolemy is run on
  European machines that use a comma "1,0" instead of a period "1.1"
  in floating point numbers.  See <a href="http://mercury.nceas.ucsb.edu/kepler/pipermail/kepler-users/2009-September/001712.html" target="_top">[Kepler-users]: Where to go with the problems of internationalization or how create account into forum?</a>

  <li> The Datagram actors do not work very well.
  The tests sometimes fail.
  See <a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54" target="_top">Bug #54: Datagram actors fail their test</code></a>.

  <li> The Display actor uses the Swing JTextArea component which is 
  known to have memory leaks.

  <li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.
  Instead, use readResource().

  <li>Matlab Interface issues
  <ul>
  <!-- If you change the next paragraph update install.htm -->

  <li>The Matlab interface works only under Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
  The Matlab interface requires that Matlab be installed on the local
  machine.  The version of the Matlab interface that is shipped with
  the release might not work with your version of Matlab.  The solution
  is to recompile from source.

  <li>Under Windows, Matlab models sometimes cause Ptolemy to exit the
  second time the model is run!
  <br>The problem seems to be a segfault within a Windows library.
  The problem only affects systems where Matlab is compiled with 
  Microsoft Visual C.

  <li> The Matlab interface is not very stable under Windows.
  As a workaround, try running the Matlab demos by compiling Ptolemy II from
  source and then running <code>vergil -jni</code>.

  </ul>

  <li> IterateOverArray issues
     <menu>
        <li> <a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=322#in_browser" target="_top">Bug #322: IterateOverArray has a Configuration clone problem</a>.
    	      <!-- Confirmed on 3/01/10 -->

	<li> IterateOverArray: When you drop in an actor, and then
	another actor, and then select "undo," the second actor is
	deleted without the first one being re-created. Thus, undo is
        only a partial undo. The fix to this is extremely
        complicated. Probably the only viable
        mechanism is to use UndoStackAttribute.getUndoInfo() to get the undo
        stack and then to manipulate the contents of that stack directly.
	
	<li> IterateOverArray: There should be an option to reset
	between firings of the inside actor.

	<li> IterateOverArray: If you drop a new actor onto an IterateOverArray
        in a subclass, it will simply acquire the new contents, but not
        actually do anything with them. It should somehow refuse to accept
        the new object in the subclass, since to do so, it would have to
        delete the original object defined in the base class, and this would
        violate the derived invariant.

        
	<li> IterateOverArray: If an instance of IterateOverArray in a derived
        class has overridden values of parameters, those are lost if
        contained entity of the instance in the base class is replaced and
        then an undo is requested.

       
        <li> IterateOverArray: When an actor with a display icon like
        Const, Expression, or MathFunction is put into
        IterateOverArray, the CopyCatIcon doesn't reflect the text display.

     </menu>

</ul>

<h3>Limitations in the PN Domain</h3>
The PN domain documents that it locally handles mutations.  However, this
is currently not true in the implementation.  For the basic PN model, this
doesn't really matter, since mutations happen pretty much the same as they
would otherwise.  (i.e. they are non-deterministic in when they execute) 
However, for timed PN models, there is actually some expressiveness
lost, since timed PN models can locally execute mutations deterministically.

 <p>Embedding a PN typed composite actor inside a non-process top level
such as DE does not work.  In fact embedding a process domain inside
a non-process domain is likely to have problems.  Profess Lee wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Yes, it looks as if the code is designed so that process domains
    (PN, CSP) can only be used within process domains.  I'm not sure
    to what extent this is a limitation of the process domains vs. a
    semantic problem.  What would PN mean within DE?  Since PN has
    no well-defined notion of a "firing", how would you assign time
    stamps to the outputs of a PN actor?  By default in DE, the time
    stamps of the outputs of an actor match those of the inputs that
    triggered the firing. There is no such notion in PN.

User Interface.

  <li> The <a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=323" target="_top">Bug #323: Up button does not work in modal models</a>.

  <li> If a parameter name end with an underscore and a number, then
    cutting and pasting drops the underscore and number.

  <li> The labeling of ports gets messed up if you change cardinality.

  <li> Cancelling a style change doesn't restore original
    state.  There are FIXME's about this in actor.gui.style.StyleConfigurer.

  <li> If there are multiple windows open for a model, say, the top
    level vergil window and the tree view, or the top level window
    and the inside look of a composite component, when the top
    level window is closed, all other windows are closed, but the
    user is not prompted to save any change to the model.

  <li> When setting the type of a port, we should provide a combo
    box that lists the common ports

  <li> When creating a Modal Model, to create a transition between
    states, hold the (Mac: Command-Mouse-Button, Windows: Control-Right-Mouse-Button)
    and drag from one state to another.  
    One potential workaround would
    be to have an information message in the status bar about this.

  <li> You should not change the names of built in ports - The port
    mechanism should disallow port name changes on ports that are
    named in Java.  The UI could recognize this.  The UI should
    not allow the user to remove built in Java defined ports.

  <li> Manually setting of the types of actors like ArrayToSequence that
    have constraints on their element types can cause problems.

  <li> HTVQ demo is badly laid out when run under vergil.
  <li> Weak support for multiports in the graph editor.
  <li> The integrated web browser is not a full-featured browser.
  <li> Debugger not yet integrated.
  <li> It is difficult to add actors to the libraries.
  <li> No dynamic class reloading.
  <li> Plot windows don't resize when control panel is resized

  <br>If a model with plotters is executed using the run button on the
  toolbar, and then re-executed using the run control panel accessed
  through the View menu, then resizing the run control panel does not
  cause the plots to resize to fit.  <br>Workaround: Close the model and
  re-open it, and then run first using the run control panel.

  <li>There is no mechanism in the UI to save a model as a class,
    nor to save a submodel as a class.

  <li>There is no mechanism in the UI to create a custom icon for
    a library element and store it in the right place.

  <li>If an actor uses a slider, then the actor tree navigator pane
    incorrectly shows the slider as a subitem of the actor.

  <li> It seems that if you close a model that has been modified,
    get prompted to save it, and select save, then the model
    is saved but not closed.  It should be closed too...

  <li> When I select a large number of items from one model, and
    copy and paste them into a new one, they sometimes all get
    placed at the origin.  Strangely, if I then auto-place,
    and then undo, they get their original (correct) placement!

  <li> <a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=289" target="_top">Bug #289: Under Mac OS X, printing to Acrobat 9.0 fails </a>
    
  <li> Printing a model that contains transparent objects can result
    in problems when printing to Encapsulated Postscript (EPS).

  <br>If a model has transparent objects, then when it is printed to
  EPS, the resulting file is a bitmap instead of a Postscript
  description of the graphics.  You can tell by the file size (several
  Meg vs. several K) and by opening it in Illustrator, where in theory
  you should be able to ungroup and select and edit individual
  components.

  <br>The way Java prints EPS is that there is an implementation of
  Graphics2D that literally translates each graphics2D call into a
  Postscript snippet.  If Java detects any transparent colors or images,
  then the literal translation of each element independently doesn't
  work, so the printing code reverts to writing everything to an image
  and then sending the image, encapsulated in Postscript to the printer.

  <br>Solution1: Use one of these pdf writing programs to generate
  pdf-1.4 compliant pdf files, which have extensions to support
  transparency that Postscript lacks, and then print them to eps, which
  would use the distill implementation of the above algorithm.
  Or alternatively, we could switch to using pdftex instead of 
  latex-&gt;dvips-&gt;distill which should
  embed pdf for figures directly at the expense of less robust latex support.

  <br>Solution 2: Use the undocumented flag
  -Dsun.java2d.print.pipeline=pdl on the command line to force the
  printing to use the postscript path, ignoring transparency.
  Under Cygwin:
  <pre>
  export JAVAFLAGS=-Dsun.java2d.print.pipeline=pdl
  vergil
  </pre>
  Then edit the file by hand in Illustrator to add the transparency back in.

</ul>

<h3>Limitations in $PTII/jni</h3>
$PTII/jni has been replaced by the
<a href="codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/jni/EmbeddedCActor.html">EmbeddedCActor</a>.
We keep $PTII/jni around because we need the launcher for use with JNI under Cygwin
and $PTII/jni has some simple JNI tests.
<ul>

  <li> The Interface to C actors using the Java Native Interface
  is not available via the Windows Installer (or Web Start).
  To use the JNI/Ptolemy II interface, you must download 
  Ptolemy II as source files and compile.

  <li> The JNI user interface was removed between Ptolemy II 4.0
  and Ptolemy II 5.0 because the UI stopped working.

</ul>
