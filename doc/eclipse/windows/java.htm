    <h1>Windows: Installing Java</h1>
    Under Windows, the Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed from Oracle, see
    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html#in_browser" target="_top"><code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</code></a>.
    <p>Java is available as both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.  Deciding
      which one to download can be complex, see <a href="32bitVs64bit.htm">32-bit or 64-bit</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Ptolemy II 10.0</b> requires Java 1.6 (also known as Java 6)
      or later because ptdb uses javax.swing.GroupLayout.  Also, Java
      1.5 is past its end of life.  Java 1.7 (also known as Java 7)
      and Java 1.8 will work.</p>

    <p><b>The development version available via svn</b> is best built
    with Java 1.8.  See below for details.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In January, 2015, the core of development version can be
	build with Java 1.6 by running configure, but this is not
	supported or tested.  Over time, Java 1.6 is less likely to
	work.
      </p>

      <p>The full development version of Ptolemy II requires Java 1.7
	because particleFiltering uses type inference for generic instance
	creation and catches multiple exceptions.  Over time, more and
	more code will require Java 1.7 and Java 1.8.</p>
      
      <p>Note that the core of Ptolemy that is used by Kepler can be
	built with Java 1.7.  To use Java 1.7 would require excluding
	ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs and org/ptolemy/machineLearning.  The core
	of Ptolemy II is built using Java 1.7 on a nightly basis as part
	of the Kepler build.</p>

      <p>The development version of Ptolemy II requires Java 1.8 to use
	Nashorn in ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs and IntStream in
	org/ptolemy/machineLearning.  Over time, more and more code will
	require Java 1.8.  The <code>$PTII/build.default.xml</code> works
	best with Java 1.8</p>

      <p>The Oracle (formerly Sun) Java Development Kit (JDK) is preferred.</p>  
      <p>The IBM JDK will work under Linux.</p>
      <p>OpenJDK may work with Ptolemy II, but could have problems with Kepler.</p>

    <p>After installing Java, then the next step is to <a href="eclipse.htm">install Eclipse</a>.
