<H1>Localized Zeno Conditions in DDE Models</H1>
<P>
The following applet uses the DDE domain of Ptolemy II to model localization
of Zeno conditions. The applet incorporates polymorphic actors in conjunction
with DDE-specific actors.

<B>Background</B>
<BR>
The above applet illustrates the localization of Zeno conditions in the
DDE domain. The demo consists of two topologically identical branches
connected to a clock
source actor. Each branch contains a feedback loop and is fed identical
tokens from the clock source. As with all feedback loops in DDE (and DE) 
models, a positive time delay is necessary in feedback loops to prevent
deadlock. If the time delay of a given loop is lower bounded by zero but 
can not be guaranteed to be greater than a fixed positive value, 
then a Zeno condition occurs in which time will cease to advance even 
though the actors of the feedback loop continue to execute without 
deadlocking.
<P>
In centralized discrete event systems, Zeno conditions prevent progress
in the entire simulation. This is true because the feedback cycle 
experiencing the Zeno condition prevents time from advancing in the 
entire model. In contrast, distributed systems localize Zeno conditions
as much as possible based on the topology of the system. Thus, as shown
in the demo above, a Zeno condition can exist in one section of a 
topology without impacting the entire system.
<P>
<B>Operation</B>
<BR>
In the above model, the bottom branch experiences a Zeno condition as soon
as time advances to 45. This causes the the bottom branch to continue 
execution long after the top branch has ceased execution, even though the 
clock source sends identical data to both branches. <I>Note that for 
convenience the lower branch only approximates a Zeno condition. It 
has been deliberately designed to eventually end the Zeno condition and
complete execution.</I>
<P>
A color coding scheme is utilized as follows:
<UL>
	<LI>BLUE: Execution has not begun.<BR> 
	<LI>YELLOW: Waiting to consume a token.<BR> 
	<LI>GREEN: Producing a token.<BR> 
	<LI>RED: Execution is complete.<BR> 
</UL>
<P>
This applet is implemented by
<TT><A HREF="LocalZenoApplet.java">LocalZenoApplet.java</A></TT>.
<P>
The model consists of the following domain-polymorphic actors:
<UL>
	<LI> <A HREF="../../../../actor/lib/Clock.java">Clock</A>
	<LI> <A HREF="../../../../actor/lib/gui/TimedPlotter.java">TimedPlotter</A>
</UL>
<P>and the following DDE actors:
<UL>
	<LI> <A HREF="../../lib/DDESink.java">DDESink</A>
	referred to as <I>Rcvr</I> in the topology above.
	<LI> <A HREF="../../lib/DoubleFork.java">DoubleFork</A> 
	referred to as <I>Join</I> in the topology above.
	<LI> <A HREF="../../kernel/FeedBackDelay.java">FeedBackDelay</A> 
	referred to as <I>FeedBack</I> in the topology above.
	<LI> <A HREF="../../lib/TimeAdvance.java">TimeAdvance</A> 
	not shown in the topology above.
</UL>
In the lower branch, the feedback actor is implemented with 
<A HREF="ZenoDelay.java">ZenoDelay</A> 
instead of FeedBackDelay to provide a delay value that <I>approximates</I> a 
Zeno condition. ZenoDelay extends FeedBackDelay.
