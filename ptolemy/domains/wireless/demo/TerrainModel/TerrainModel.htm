<p>This simple example illustrates modeling terrain effects. The TerrainProperty
models an obstacle that attenuates the communication from the Sender 
to the Receiver if the communication path between them intersects with
the terrain shape. When you run this model, the sender will emit a signal
twice per second. The Receiver will move around the Sender and measure
the received power. It then plots the received power on a polar plot.
The plot shows that the receiver gets reduced power when the signal is
shadowed by the terrain model, and that the power depends on how much of
the obstacle is travered by the line-of-sight signal.</p>
