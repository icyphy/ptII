    <h1>Ptolemy Event Relation Actor (PTERA) Domain</h1>

    <p>The Ptera (Ptolemy Event Relation Actor) domain is a
      discrete-event model of computation. A model in Ptera is
      represented with a graph of nodes and edges, where nodes
      represent events and directed edges between events represent
      scheduling relation. One or more events can be selected as
      initial events, which are scheduled at model time 0.0. When an
      event is fired, it possibly performs certain actions, and if
      there are outgoing edges from that event, the events at the end
      points of those edges are scheduled after non-negative
      delays. One or more events can also be selected as final
      events. The firing of final events causes the event queue to be
      emptied after their actions are performed, and therefore no more
      events can be processed.

    <p>The Ptera domain supports a different kind of modal models
      called PteraModalModels, compared to modal models using FSMs
      (Finite State Machines) as the control. A PteraModalModel uses
      Ptera at the top level, and each event is refined into a
      sub-model. The refinements can use Ptera and any other Ptolemy
      models of computation.</p>

    <p>A Ptera model is timed. Although it should work in many
      domains, the DE (Discrete-Event) domain or Ptera domain itself are
      recommended. When embedded in those domains, the scheduling of the
      Ptera model is delegated to the container by calling the fireAt()
      function of its director.</p>

    <p>There are many useful additional features for Ptera, such as
      canceling edges and parameters. A canceling edge, denoted by a
      dotted line, cancels a previously scheduled event instead of
      scheduling a new one. If the pointed to event has multiple
      instances in the event queue, then the first instance is
      cancelled.  Events may also have parameters, and the actual
      values for those parameters are specified by the expressions on
      the edges that schedule them. Those expressions are evaluated at
      run-time. The events may refer to the values of those parameters
      in their actions by parameter names.</p>
