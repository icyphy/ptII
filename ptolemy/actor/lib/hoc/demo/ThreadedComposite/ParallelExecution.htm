<p>The ThreadedComposite actors in this model have delay 0.0 and just copy their input
tokens to the output, so executing this model produces an interleaving of two counting
sequences, one counting up, and one counting down.</p>

<p>However, the ThreadedComposites take a full 1.0 and 1.5 seconds respectively to execute
(this implemented with a Sleep actor inside). That execution occurs in parallel so the total
time between outputs is approximately 1.5 seconds (the other actors all execute so quickly
that their execution time is not noticable).</p>

<p>This illustrates that ThreadedComposite can be used to execute actors concurrently.
If they block on I/O, for example, they will not block other actors except as necessary
to preserve DE semantics. On a multicore machine, the ThreadedComposites can execute
on separate cores, thus exploiting parallelism.</p>
