<h1>Plot data read from a URL</h1>
<hr>
The plot below obtains its data from an ASCII
<a href="data.plt">data file</a> at a URL.
It shows certain features of the plotter.
<p>
<applet name="Marks" code="ptolemy.plot.PlotApplet" width=500 height=400
    codebase="../../.."
    archive="ptolemy/plot/ptolemy.plotapplet.jar"
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."
>
<param name="dataurl" value="data.plt">
<param name="background" value="faf0e6">
   <hr>If your browser recognized the applet tag,
    you would see an applet here.<hr>
</applet>
<p>
Note that color is disabled, and individual marks
are used for the first ten data sets.  After that, the marks are recycled,
so the eleventh data set is indistinguishable from the first.
(Had we used color, we would be able to distinguish up to 110
distinct datasets, although the Plot class will only
currently display up to 64).
Also note that the first two data sets are connected with lines,
but the remaining data sets are not.
The ranges for the horizontal and vertical axes are computed automatically from
the data, but the tick marks for the horizontal axis are specified explicitly
in the ASCII file.
This is why they appear as words rather than numbers.
Note further that each axis and each data set is labeled by a string
given in the data file.
For details about the file format, see the documentation for the
<a href="../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy.plot.Plot.html">Plot</a> and
<a href="../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy.plot.PlotBox.html">PlotBox</a> classes.
