<p>This model demonstrates HDF, which has static scheduling like SDF,
but allows production and consumption rates to vary dynamically.
In this example, the factor parameter of a DownSample actor is
varied over the course of execution of the model. The HDF director
calculates a new schedule each time the downsampling rate is
changed. The model produces a Fibonacci sequence.</p>

<p>In a Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two
numbers. One way to generate such a sequence is to extract the
Fibonacci numbers from a counting sequence (the natural numbers)
by sampling each number that is a Fibonacci number. This can be
done by a DownSample actor where the n-th Fibonacci number is generated
by downsampling with a factor given by the (n-2)th Fibonacci number.</p>
