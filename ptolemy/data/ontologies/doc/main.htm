<h1>Ontologies</h1>

<p>    The Ptolemy II Ontologies package extends the Ptolemy II type inference engine to provide an efficient and scalable framework for general static analysis of arbitrary properties on a Ptolemy model. The framework supports properties that are specified as concepts in an ontology graph that must be structured as a lattice. The usefulness of this framework is demonstrated with an example of a physical dimensions ontology. This ontology labels different signals as representing acceleration, velocity, position, and time. In a Ptolemy model of physical dynamics, the dimensional properties of input and output signals can be automatically inferred using the ontology analysis. Ptolemy model developers can use the ontologies package to define their own ontologies for structural and semantic property analysis. This can prevent interface connection problems during model construction by identifying when incompatible signals are erroneously connected. This work draws on concepts from compiler optimization static analysis techniques and applies them to Ptolemy actor-oriented models.</p>
