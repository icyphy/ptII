This model shows how level crossing
detector handles the continuous signals
with and without discontinuity. 

<p>The level crossing detector has two
operation modes. For continuous signals,
the detector try to refine step size to
find the point level crossing happens.
At the time points where discontinuities
happen, the detector does not try to
refine step size (which is 0.0 already),
but to detect the level crossing only.

<p>The output event of level crossing
detectors have the value as the specified
"level" parameter. If the "useDefaultEventValue"
is checked, the event has value as parameter
"defaultEventValue".

<p>The <a href="LevelCrossingDetectorVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
