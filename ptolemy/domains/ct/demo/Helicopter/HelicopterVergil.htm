This applet models a high-attitude take off motion of a helicopter with a modal controller. Only the motion along longitudinal and vertical axes is considered (so we call it a 2-D helicopter).
<P>
The x, z-axes of the spatial frame are pointing north and down. The body x-axis is defined from the center of gravity to the nose of the helicopter, and body z-axis is pointing down from the center of gravity (CG). The motion of the helicopter is controlled by the main rotor thrust, and the longitudinal tilt path angle.
<P>
Flight modes represent different modes of operation of the helicopter and they correspond to controlling different variables in the dynamic. We define the following flight modes: Hover, Cruise, Acc/ALH, Dec/ALH, Climb, and Descend, where ALH stands for "ALtitude Hold."
<P>
The control uses approximate feedback linearization and pole placement.
The top level system looks like.

<P>
The climb action consists of a sequence of flight modes. Inside the controller
block is the FSM domain, where each FSM state represents a flight mode. Each
flight mode is further refined into a continuous time controller. The model
inside the controller is shown below.
