This directory contains Ptolemy applications and speculative work.
This directory is _not_ shipped with the public releases.

To save space and make for faster check outs, the ptIIapps cvs
repository was set up and the following apps moved to it:

agilent        kurt           pendulum       soot           wireless
ant            kvm            rijndael       superb
